Lester Holt,"Comment on every topic, but over the course of the next two hours, we will hear from everyone. We’d also like to ask the audience to keep their reactions to a minimum, we are not going to be shy about making sure that candidates stick to time tonight.",June
Savannah,"All right, so with that business out of the way, we want to get to it and we’ll start this evening with Senator Elizabeth Warren. Senator, good evening to you.",June
Elizabeth W.,Thank you.  to be here.,June
Savannah,"You have many plans. Free college, free childcare, government healthcare, cancellation of student debt, new taxes, new regulations, the breakup of major corporations, but this comes at a time when 71% of Americans say the economy is doing well, including 60% of Democrats.",June
Savannah,What do you say to those who worry this kind of significant change could be risky to the economy?,June
Elizabeth W.,"I think of it this way. Who is this economy really working for? It’s doing great for thinner and thinner slice at the top. It’s doing great for giant drug companies. It’s just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled. It’s doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons, just not for the African Americans and Latin X whose families were torn apart, whose lives are destroyed and whose communities are ruined. It’s doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us.",June
Elizabeth W.,"When you’ve got a government, when you’ve got an autonomy, that does great for those with money and isn’t doing great for everyone else, that is corruption pure and simple, we need to call it out, we need to attack it head on, and we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.",June
Savannah,"Senator Klobuchar, you’ve called programs like free college, something you might do if you were, “A magic genie.” To be blunt, are the government programs and benefits that some of your rivals are offering, giving your voters, people, a false sense of what’s actually achievable?",June
Amy Klobuchar,"Well, first the economy. We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity and Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what’s going on, when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums. I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids, I do, but I think my plan is a good one, and my plan would be to first of all make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile, gets help with their education. My own dad and my sister, got their first degrees with community college. There’s many paths to success as well as certifications.",June
Amy Klobuchar,"Secondly, I’d use Pell Grants. I’d double them from 6,000 to $12,000 a year, and expand it to the number of families that get covered, to families that make up to $100,000.",June
Amy Klobuchar,"And then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans. Because I can tell you this, if billionaires can pay off their yacht, students should be able to pay off their student loans.",June
Savannah,That’s time. Thank you.,June
Savannah,"Congressman O’Rourke, what we’ve just been discussing and talking about is how much fundamental change to the economy is desirable and how much is actually doable? In that vein, some Democrats want a marginal individual tax rate of 70% on the very highest earners, those making more than $10 million a year. Would you support that? And if not, what would your top individual rate be?",June
Beto O’Rourke,"This economy has got to work for everyone, and right now we know that it isn’t. It’s going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does.",June
Beto O’Rourke,.,June
Beto O’Rourke,"Right now we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes. That’s how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest, a $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality.",June
Beto O’Rourke,"A new democracy that is revived because we’ve returned power to the people, no packs, no gerrymandering, automatic and same day voter registration to bring in more voters, and a new voting rights act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now, that’s how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody.",June
Savannah,"Congressman, that’s time sir.",June
Savannah,"I’ll give you 10 seconds to answer if you want to answer the direct question, would you support a 70% individual marginal tax rate? Yes, no, or pass?",June
Beto O’Rourke,I would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone. Tax capital –,June
Savannah,70% ?,June
Beto O’Rourke,"At the same rate that you tax ordinary income, take that corporate tax rate up to 28%, you would generate the revenues you need to pay for the programs we’re talking about.",June
Savannah,That’s time. Thank you.,June
Savannah,"Senator Booker, there is a debate in this party right now about the role of corporations as you know. Senator Warren in particular, put out a plan to break up tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. You’ve said we should not, “Be running around pointing at companies and breaking them up without any kind of process.” Why do you disagree?",June
Cory Booker,"I don’t think I disagree, I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation, and you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from labor and we have people that work full-time jobs and still can’t make a living wage. We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs, and you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that’s hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete.",June
Cory Booker,"One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the Ag sector. So I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work. I’ll tell you this, I live in a low income black and brown community. I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans.",June
Cory Booker,"The indicators that are being used from GDP to Wall Street’s rankings, is not helping people in my community. It is about time that we have economy that works for every body not just the wealthiest in our nation.",June
Savannah,"But quickly Senator Booker, you did say that you didn’t think it was right to name names, to name companies and single them out as Senator Warren has. Briefly, why is that?",June
Cory Booker,"Well again, I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes, and I’ll need to change that. When it comes to antitrust law, what I will do is, number one, appoint judges that will enforce it. Number two, have a DOJ and a federal trade commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration. At the end of the day, we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing. We see that with everything from citizens united and the way they’re trying to influence Washington.",June
Cory Booker,"It’s about time that we have a president that fights for the people in this country, we need to have someone that’s a champion for them.",June
Savannah,"Thank you, senator. Senator Warren, I mentioned you. Are you picking winners and losers?",June
Elizabeth W.,"The way I understand this, is there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country, that hurts workers, it hurts small businesses, it hurts independent farmers, it hurts our economy overall, and it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy.",June
Elizabeth W.,"Now look, we’ve had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back. What’s been missing is courage, courage in Washington to take on the giants. That’s part of the corruption in this system. It has been far too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions, have been funding the super packs, have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in Washington.",June
Elizabeth W.,"Where I want to start this is I want to return government to the people and that means calling out the names of the monopolies and saying, “I have the courage to go after them.”",June
Savannah,Thank you.,June
Lester Holt,"Secretary Castro, the next question is for you. Democrats have been talking about the pay gap for decades. What would you do to ensure that women are paid fairly in this country?",June
Julián Castro,"Thank you very much for that question, Lester. I grew up with a mother who raised my brother Joaquin and me as a single parent, and I know what it’s like to struggle, I know what it’s like to rent a home and to worry about whether you’re going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month, and to see a mom work very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they’re women, I would do several things starting with something we should’ve done a long time ago, which is to pass the Equal Rights Amendment finally in this country and also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country.",June
Julián Castro,"It’s past time that we did that, and we have to do this. If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve.",June
Lester Holt,"All right, thank you. I want to put the same question to Congresswoman Gabbard, your thoughts on equal pay.",June
Tulsi Gabbard,"First of all, let’s recognize the situation we’re in, that the American people deserve a president who will put your interests ahead of the rich and powerful, that’s not what we have right now.",June
Tulsi Gabbard,"I enlisted in the Army National Guard after the Al-Qaida terror attacks on 911, so I could go after those who had attacked us on that day, I still serve as a Major. I served over 16 years, deployed twice in the Middle East, and in Congress, I’ve serve on the foreign affairs and armed services committees for over six years. I know the importance of our national security, as well as the terribly high cost of war. And for too long, our leaders have failed us, taking us from one regime change war to the next, leading us into a new cold war, an arms race costing us trillions of our hard earned taxpayer dollars and countless lives.",June
Tulsi Gabbard,"This insanity must end, and as president I will take your hard earned taxpayer dollars and instead, invest those dollars into serving your needs. Things like healthcare, a green economy, good paying jobs, protecting our environment, and so much more.",June
Jose,"Mayor Blasio, good evening. You’re the mayor of the biggest city in the United States, but it’s also one of the cities in the country with the greatest gap between the wealthy and the poor. How would you address income inequality?",June
Bill De Blasio,"Well, we’ve been addressing income inequality in New York City by raising wages, by raising benefits, by putting money back in the hands of working people, $15 minimum wage, paid sick days, pre-K for all, things that are making a huge difference in working people’s lives. But let me tell you, what we’re hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party. I want to make it clear, this is supposed to be the party of working people. Yes, we’re supposed to be for 70% tax rate on the wealthy, yes, we’re supposed to be for free college, free public college, for our young people. We are supposed to break up big corporations when they’re not serving our democracy.",June
Bill De Blasio,"This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive, and in New York we’ve proven that we can do something very different, we can put money back in the hands of working people. And let me tell you, every time you talk about investing in people, in their communities, you hear folks saying there’s not enough money. What I say to them every single time is, “There’s plenty of money in this world, there’s plenty of money in this country, it’s just in the wrong hands.”",June
Jose,Thank you. Congressman –,June
Bill De Blasio,have to fix that.,June
Jose,"Congressman Delaney, you agree?",June
John Delaney,"I think we need to do real things to help American workers and the American people, this is the issue that all of us hear on the campaign trail. We need to make sure everyone has a living wage, and I’ve called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating paid family leave. That will create a situation where people actually have a living wage that gets right to workers.",June
John Delaney,"Then we got to fix our public education system. It’s not delivering the results our kids needs, nor is college, and post high school, career and technical training programs, doing that. I’m very different than everyone else here on this stage. Prior to being in Congress, I was an entrepreneur. I started two businesses. I created thousands of jobs. I spent my whole career helping small to midsize businesses all over the country. 5,000 of them, I supported. The Obama Administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities.",June
John Delaney,"I know how to create jobs. We need a short-term strategy, which is to put money in the pockets of workers, with earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage and created paid family leave, and then we need to have a long-term strategy to make sure this country is competitive, and we’re creating jobs everywhere in this country.",June
Jose,"Thank you. Governor Inslee, how would you address income inequality?",June
Jay Inslee,"Well, I’m a little bit surprised. I think plans are great, but I’m a governor and we got to realize the people who brought us the weekend, unions, neither are going to bring us a long overdue raise in America, and I’m proud of standing up for unions, I’ve got a plan to reinvigorate collective bargaining, so we can increase wages finally.",June
Jay Inslee,"I marched with the SEIU folks. It is not right that the CEO of McDonald’s makes 2,100 times more than the people slinging hash at McDonald’s. And the next thing I’ll do is put people to work in the jobs of the present and the future. Donald Trump is simply wrong. He says wind turbines cause cancer, we know they cause jobs, and we know that we can put millions of people to work in the clean energy jobs of the future, carpenters, IBWs members, machinists.",June
Jay Inslee,"We’re doing it in my state today, and then we can do what America always does, lead the world and invent the future and put people to work. That’s what we’re going to do in all the states.",June
Jose,"Congressman Ryan, president Trump… and you just referred to him, promised that manufacturing jobs were all coming back to places like your home state of Ohio. Can you make that same promise?",June
Tim Ryan,"Yes, I believe you can. But first, let’s say that president came he said, “Don’t sell your house to people in Youngstown, Ohio,” and in his administration, just in the last two years, we lost 4,000 jobs at a General Motors facility, that rippled throughout our community. General Motors got a tax cut. General Motors got a bail out. And then they have the audacity to move a new car that they’re going to produce to Mexico.",June
Tim Ryan,"I’ve had family members that have had to unbolt a machine from the factory floor, put it in a box, and ship it to China. My area where I come from in northeast Ohio, this issue we’re talking about here, it’s been going on 40 years. This is not a new phenomenon in the United States of America. The bottom 60% haven’t seen a raise since 1980, meanwhile, the top 1% controlled 90% of the wealth. We need an industrial policy saying, “We’re going to dominate building electric vehicles. There’s going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years. I want half of them made in the United States. I want to dominate the solar industry, and manufacturer those here in the United States.”",June
Jose,"Thank you. Senator Warren, are they coming back? Are these jobs coming back?",June
Elizabeth W.,"We’ve had an industrial policy in the United States for decades now, and it’s basically been letting giant corporations do whatever they want to do. Giant corporations have exactly one loyalty and that is to profit, and if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to Canada, they’re going to do it. So here’s what I propose for an industrial policy. Start with a place where there’s a real need. There’s going to be a worldwide need for green technology, ways to clean up the air, ways to clean up the water, and we can be the ones to provide that.",June
Elizabeth W.,"We need to go 10 fold in our research and development on green energy going forward, and then we need to say any corporation can come and use that research, they can make all kinds of products from it, but they have to be manufactured right here in the United States of America. And then we have to double down and sell it around the world.",June
Elizabeth W.,"There’s a $23 trillion market coming for green products, we should be the leaders and the owners and we should have that 1.2 million manufacturing jobs here in America. We can do this.",June
Lester Holt,"Thank you. All right, we’re going to turn to the issue of healthcare right now, and really try to understand where there may or may not be daylight between you. Many people watching at home have health insurance coverage through their employer. Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government run plan? Just a show of hands, to start off with.",June
Lester Holt,"All right. Well, Senator Klobuchar, let me put the question to you. You’re one of the Democrats who wants to keep private insurance in addition to a government healthcare plan. Why is an incremental approach in your view better than sweeping overhaul?",June
Amy Klobuchar,"I think it’s a bold approach. It’s something that Barack Obama wanted to do when we were working on the Affordable Care Act, and that is a public option. I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says. So let me go on beyond that. There’s a much bigger issue in addition to that, and that is pharmaceuticals.",June
Amy Klobuchar,"The president literally went on TV on Fox and said that, people’s heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices. Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double digits since he came into office. Instead, he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the Pharma companies. For the rest of us, for the rest of America, that’s what we call at home, all foam and no beer. We got nothing out of it. And so my proposal is to do something about Pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries. Pharma thinks they own Washington, well they don’t own me.",June
Lester Holt,"Your time is up, thank you. Senator Warren, you signed onto Bernie Sanders’ Medicare-for-all plan, and it would put essentially everybody on Medicare and then eliminate private plans that offers similar coverage. Is that the plan or path that you would pursue as president?",June
Elizabeth W.,"Yes, I’m with Bernie on Medicare-for-all, and let me tell you why. I’ve spend a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is the cost of healthcare, medical bills. And that’s not just for people who don’t have insurance, it’s for people who have insurance. Look at the business model of an insurance company. It’s to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and pay out as few dollars as possible for your healthcare. That leaves families with rising premiums, rising copays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the healthcare that their doctors say that they and their children need.",June
Elizabeth W.,"Medicare-for-all solves that problem. I understand there are a lot of politicians who say, “Oh, it’s just not possible. We just can’t do it. It’s… ” Have a lot of political reasons for this, what they’re really telling you is they just won’t fight for it. Well, healthcare is a basic human right and I will fight for basic human right .",June
Lester Holt,"Congressman O’Rourke, when you ran for Senate, you also praised the bill that would replace private insurance. This year you’re saying you’re no longer sure. Can you explain why?",June
Beto O’Rourke,"My goal is to ensure that every American is well enough to live to their full potential because they have health care. In Laredo, Texas, I met a young man 27 years old, told me that he’d been to a doctor once in his life and on that visit he was told he had Diabetes, he was told he had Glaucoma, and he was told untreated because he doesn’t have health care, he’ll be dead before the age of 40.",June
Beto O’Rourke,"So getting to guaranteed, high quality universal health care as quickly and surely as possible, has to be our goal. The ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider. The ability to see a mental health care provider. In Texas, the single largest provider of mental healthcare services is the county jail system, today.",June
Beto O’Rourke,"Health care also has to mean that every woman can make her own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible. Our plan says, if you’re uninsured, we enroll you in medicare. If you’re insufficiently insured, you can’t afford your premiums, we enroll you in medicare. But if you’re a member of a union that negotiated for a healthcare plan that you like because it works for you and your family, you’re able to keep it. We preserve choice by making sure everybody has health care.",June
Lester Holt,Your time is up congressman. But I do want to ask a follow-up on this just to be very clear. I’ll give you 10 seconds. Would you replace private insurance?,June
Beto O’Rourke,No. I think the choice is fundamental to our ability to get everybody cared for.,June
Bill De Blasio,"Hey, wait, wait. . Private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans. When you talk about the copays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out of pocket expenses, it’s not working. How can you defend the system that’s not working?",June
Beto O’Rourke,"That’s right, so for those who’s not working they can choose medicare. For the  –",June
Bill De Blasio,You got to start by acknowledging the system is not working for people.,June
Beto O’Rourke,They’re able to keep them.,June
Bill De Blasio,Why are you defending private insurance  –,June
John Delaney,"100 million Americans say they like their private health insurance, by the way. It should be noted that 100 million Americans… I think we should be the party that keeps what’s working and fixes what’s broken. Doesn’t that make sense? We should give everyone in this country, healthcare is a basic human right for free. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people and also it’s bad policy if you go to every hospital in this country and you asked them one question which is, how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the medicare rate? Every single hospital administrator said they would close.",June
John Delaney,"The Medicare-for-all bill requires payments to stay at current medicare rates. So to some extent we’re basically supporting a bill that will have every hospital closed. My dad was a union electrician, I actually grew up in a working class family. He loved the health care that the IBW gave him. I just always think about my dad at anything I would do, from a policy perspective. He’d look at me and he’d say, “Good job John, for getting healthcare for every American. But why are you taking my health care away?”",June
Lester Holt,"I’ve let this play a little bit because I’m fascinated to hear the daylight between you. Congresswoman Gabbard, will you weigh in here?",June
Tulsi Gabbard,"Yes. I think we’re talking about this in the wrong way. You’re talking about one bill over another bill. Really what we’re talking about is our objective. Making sure that every single sick American in this country is able to get the healthcare that they need. I believe Medicare-for-all is the way to do that. I also think that employers will recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a Medicare-for-all program. A program that will reduce the administrative costs, reduce the bureaucratic costs, and make sure that everyone gets that quality healthcare that they need.",June
Tulsi Gabbard,"I also think if you look at other countries in the world who have universal healthcare, every one of them has form of a role of private insurance. I think that’s what we’ve got to look at, taking the best of these ideas, but making sure unequivocally that no sick American goes without getting the care that they need regardless of how much or little money they have in their pocket.",June
Lester Holt,"Congresswoman, thanks. Let me turn to Senator Booker on this. Senator Booker, explain to me where you are. This is hugely important to people, so tell us where you are.",June
Cory Booker,"I absolutely will. First of all, we’re talking about this as a healthcare issue, but in communities like mine, low income communities, this is an education issue because kids who don’t have health care are not going to succeed in school. It is an issue for jobs and employment because people who do not have good healthcare, do not succeed at work. It’s even a retirement issue because in my community, African Americans have a lower life expectancy because of poor health care, and so where I stand is very clear.",June
Cory Booker,"Healthcare is not just a human right, it should be an American right, and I believe the best way to get there is Medicare-for-all but I have an urgency about this. When I am president of the United States, I’m not going to wait. We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care. And on this debate, I’m sorry. There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America, from pharmaceutical companies to insurers.",June
Cory Booker,"Literally the overhead for insurers that they charge is 15%, while medicare overhead is only at 2%. We can do this better, and every single day I’ll be fighting to give people more access and more affordable cost until we get to my goal, which is every American having health care.",June
Lester Holt,"Your time is up Senator. I want to move back if I can, to congresswoman Gabbard.",June
Elizabeth W.,", and that is that the insurance companies last year alone, suck $23 billion in profits out of the healthcare system, $23 billion, and that doesn’t count the money that was paid to executives, the money that was spent lobbying Washington. We have a giant industry that wants our healthcare system to stay the way it is because it’s not working for families, but it’s sure as heck working for them. It’s time for us to make families come first.",June
Lester Holt,Governor Inslee.,June
Jay Inslee,"It should not be an option in United States of America for any insurance company to deny women coverage for their exercise of their right of choice. And I am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman’s right of reproductive health and health insurance, and I’m the only candidate who has passed a public option. I respect everybody’s goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate that has actually advanced the ball, and we got to have access for everyone. I’ve done it  –",June
Lester Holt,Your time is up Governor Inslee.  –,June
Lester Holt,"I’m fascinated by this, Senator Klobuchar.",June
Amy Klobuchar,"I just wanted to say there’s three women up here that have fought pretty hard for woman’s right to choose, I’ll start with that. And then I just want to make very clear, I think we share the goal of universal health care, and the idea I put out there, the public option, which the governor was just talking about, this idea is that you use medicare or medicaid without any insurance companies involved, you could do it either way. And the estimates are, 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums, 12 more million people would get covered. So I think it is a beginning in the way you start and the way you move to universal healthcare.",June
Lester Holt,"Senator Castro, this one is for you. All of you on stage support a woman’s right to an abortion, you all support some version of a government healthcare option. Would your plan cover abortion Mr. Secretary?",June
Julián Castro,"Oh yes, it would. I don’t believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice. What that means is, that just because a woman or… let’s also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female, is poor, doesn’t mean they shouldn’t have the right to exercise that right to choose. And so I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion. More than that, everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today, a person’s right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri, in Alabama, in Georgia, I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v. Wade, and will respect it. And in addition to that, make sure that we fight hard as we transition our health care system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right.",June
Lester Holt,"Senator Warren, would you put any limits on abortion?",June
Elizabeth W.,"I would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive health care services and that includes birth control, it includes abortion, it includes everything for a woman. And I want to add on that, it’s not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us. 47 years ago, Roe versus Wade was decided, and we’ve all looked to the courts all that time, as state after state has undermined Roe, has put in exceptions, has come right up to the edge of taking away protection.",June
Lester Holt,Your time is up Senator.,June
Elizabeth W.,We now have an America where most people support Roe versus Wade. We need to make that a federal law.,June
Lester Holt,Thank you. Jose.,June
Jose,"Lester, thank you.",June
Jose,"Senator Booker, I want to kind of come back on a discussion we were having about health and the opioid crisis. You represent a state where 14 of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies are based. Should the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these drugs be held criminally liable for what they do?",June
Cory Booker,"They should absolutely be held criminally liable because they are liable and responsible. This is one of the reasons why, well, before I was running for president, I said I would not take contributions from pharma companies, not take contributions from corporate packs, or pharma executives, because they are part of this problem.",June
Cory Booker,"This opioid addiction in our country, we in cities like mine have been seeing how we’ve tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long. It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that.",June
Jose,"Congressman O’Rourke, how would you deal with it?",June
Beto O’Rourke,"Tonight in this country, you have 2.3 million of our fellow Americans behind bars. It’s the largest prison population on the face of the planet. Many are there for nonviolent drug crimes, including possession of marijuana at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized it, and yet, despite what Purdue Pharma has done, their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we’re seeing throughout this country, they’ve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences, not a single night in jail.",June
Beto O’Rourke,"Unless there’s accountability and justice, this crisis will continue. In my administration, we will hold them to account, we’ll make sure that they pay a price, and we will help those who’ve been victims of this malfeasance in this country get them treatment and long-term care.",June
Lester Holt,"I know immigration is a lot in your minds here, and I want to talk about it. We’re going to talk about in a moment. We need to take a break. We’ll be back with more from Miami after this.",June

Who will make the most of the moment? The first democratic debate moderated by Lester Holt, Savannah Guthrie, Jose Diaz-Balart, Chuck Todd, and Rachel Maddow. Tomorrow at nine eastern on NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo.",June
Jose,"I want to turn to an issue that has been in the news, especially this week. There are undocumented children being held alone in detention. Even as close as Homestead, Florida, right here less than 30 miles from where we are tonight, fathers and mothers and children are dying while trying to enter the United States of America.",June
Jose,"We saw that image today, it broke our hearts, and they had names. All scattered, Martinez and his 23 month old daughter Valeria died trying to cross the river to ask for asylum in this country. Last month, more than 130,000 migrants were apprehended to the southern border.",June
Jose,"Secretary Castro, if you were president today, what would you specifically do?",June
Julián Castro,"Thank you very much, Jose. I’m very proud that in April I became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan and we saw those images. Watching that image of Oscar and his daughter, Valeria, is heartbreaking, it should also piss us all off.",June
Audience,Yeah.,June
Julián Castro,"If I were president today… It should spur us to action, if I were president today, I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump’s zero tolerance policy, the remain in Mexico policy, and the metering policy. This metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river. They had been playing games with people who were coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry.",June
Julián Castro,"Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim, so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river and they died because of that.",June
Jose,"On day one, sorry.  –",June
Julián Castro,"On day one, I would do that executive order that would address metering and then I would follow that up in my first a 100 days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims, that would put undocumented immigrants as long as they haven’t committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship, and then we’d go to the root cause of the issue, which is we need a Marshall Plan for Honduras, and Guatemala, and El Salvador, so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the United States to seek it.",June
Jose,"Senator Booker, what would you do on day one? And this is a situation that the next president will inherit.",June
Cory Booker,Yes. .,June
Cory Booker,"On day one, I will make sure that, number one we end the ICE policies and the customs and border policies are violating the human rights. When people come to this country, they do not leave their human rights at the border. Number two, I will make sure that we reinstate DACA, that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipients and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protected status can stay and remain here. And then finally, we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place, by making major investments in the northern triangle not like this president is doing, by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem. We cannot surrender our values and think that we’re going to get border security, we actually will lose security and our values. We must fight for both.",June
Julián Castro,", if I may add very briefly, and this is an important point, my plan… and I’m glad to see that Senator Booker, Senator Warren and governor Inslee agree with me on this, my plan also includes getting rid of section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. To go back to the way we used to treat this, when somebody comes across the border not to criminalize desperation, to treat that as a civil violation, and here’s why it’s important. We see all of this horrendous family separation, they use that law section 1325 to justify under the law separating little children from their families, and so I want to challenge every single candidate on this stage to support the repeal of section 1325.",June
Cory Booker,". As my friend here said, I agree with that one issue, but folks should understand that the separation of children from families doesn’t just go on at our border, it happens in our communities, as ICE are ripping away parents from their American children, spouses, and the like, and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work.",June
Cory Booker,We must end those policies as well.,June
Bill De Blasio,discussion about immigration  –,June
Jose,Mayor?,June
Bill De Blasio,"This country, because look at the bottom line here, those tragic, that tragic photo of those, that parent, that child, and I’m saying this as a father, every American should feel that in their heart. Every American should say that is not America, those are not our values, but we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system because we’re not being honest about the division that’s been fomented in this country. The way that American citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges, for all the American citizens out there who feel you’re falling behind or feel the American dream is not working for you, the immigrants didn’t do that to you, the big corporations did that to you, the 1% did that to you.",June
Bill De Blasio,"We need to be the party of working people, and that includes a party of immigrants, but first we have to tell working people in America who are hurting, that we’re going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with and remind people we’re all in this together. If we don’t change that debate, that politics that’s holding us back, we won’t get all these reforms people are talking about. That’s what we need to do as Democrats.",June
Jose,"Thank you. . What would you do, Congressman, day one at the White House?",June
Beto O’Rourke,". We would not turn back Valeria and her father Oscar, we would accept them into this country and follow our own asylum laws. We would not build walls, we would not put kids in cages. In fact, we would spare no expense to reunite the families that have been separated already,  –",June
Jose,"Secretary, let him finish, and I will give you… But let him finish. Let him finish.",June
Beto O’Rourke,"Yes, we would not detain any family fleeing violence. In fact, fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today, we would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost, and then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image. Free dreamers forever from any fear of deportation by making them US citizens here in this country. Invest in solutions in Central America, work with regional stakeholders, so there’s no reason to make that 2000 mile journey to this country.",June
Jose,"Secretary, I’ll give you 30 seconds.",June
Julián Castro,"Let’s be very clear. The reason that they’re separating these little children from their families is that they’re using section 1325 of that act, which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them. Some of us on this stage have called to end that section to terminate it, some like congressman O’Rourke have not, and I want to challenge all of the candidates to do that .",June
Julián Castro,"I just think it’s a mistake, I think it’s a mistake, and I think that if you truly want to change the system, then we got to repeal that section. If not, then it might as well be the same policy.",June
Jose,Thank you.,June
Beto O’Rourke,"Let me respond to this very briefly. Actually as a member of Congress, I’d help to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don’t criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country. If you’re fleeing desperation, then I want to make sure that you’re treated with respect.",June
Julián Castro,I’m still talking about everybody else.,June
Beto O’Rourke,"But you’re looking at just one small part of this. I’m talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws and if we do that, I don’t think it’s asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country.",June
Julián Castro,"That’s not true. I’m talking about millions of folks. A lot of folks that are coming are not seeking asylum and a lot of them are undocumented immigrants. And you said recently that the reason you didn’t want to repeal section 1325 was because you were concerned about human trafficking and drug trafficking. But let me tell you what, section 18 –",June
Jose,Secretary?,June
Julián Castro,"Title 18 of the US code, title 21, and title 22, already cover human  –",June
Jose,"This is an issue that we should and could be talking about for a long time and we will, for a long time.",June
John Delaney,Can we talk about the conditions why people are coming here?,June
Jose,"Let’s let Lester… Savannah, sorry. I know it’s just we could go on –",June
John Delaney,"But rather than talking about specific provisions, we really have to talk about why these people are coming to our country, and what are we going to do to actually make a difference in these countries?",June
Savannah,"Congressman, you’ll get your chance. Let’s continue the discussion. Senator Klobuchar?",June
Amy Klobuchar,Yes.,June
Savannah,"Let’s talk about what Secretary Castro just said. He wants to no longer have it be a crime to illegally cross the border. Do you support that? Do you think it should be a civil offense only? And if so, do you worry about potentially incentivizing people to come here?",June
Amy Klobuchar,"Immigrants, they do not diminish America, they are America, and I am happy to look at his proposal, but I do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law. What I really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here. And that is that, 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed by people that came from other countries. 25% of our US Nobel laureates were born in other countries.",June
Amy Klobuchar,"We have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories, we need them to start small businesses, we need their ideas, and this president has literally gone backwards at a time where our economy needs immigrants. And so my proposal is to look at that 2013 bill that passed in Senate, which Republican support, to upgrade that bill to make it as good as possible and get it done. It brings the debt down by $158 billion. It gives a path to citizenship, for citizen, for people who can become citizens, and it would be much better for our economy in America.",June
Savannah,"Senator, that’s time. Thank you. Congressman Ryan, same question. Should it be a crime to illegally cross the border or should be a civil offense only?",June
Tim Ryan,"Well, I agree with Secretary Castro. I think there are other provisions in the law that will allow you to prosecute people for coming over here if they’re dealing in drugs and other things, that’s already established in the law. So there’s no need to repeat it. And I think it’s abhorrent we’re talking about this father who got killed with his daughter, and the issues here the way these kids are being treated, if you go to Guantanamo Bay, there are terrorists that are held, they get better health care than those kids that have tried to cross the border in the United States. That needs to stop. And I think the president should immediately ask doctors and nurses to go immediately down to the border and start taking care of these kids.",June
Tim Ryan,"What kind of country are we running here, where we have a president of the United States who’s so focused on hate and fear and division? What the hell has happened now, the end result, is now we’ve got kids literally laying in their own snot with three week old diapers that haven’t been changed. We’ve got to tell this president that is not a sign of strength Mr. President, that is a sign of weakness  –",June
Savannah,"Senator Booker, a lot of people, Jose asked the question, if you’re a president, on day one, what will you do with the fact that you will have families here? There’s been a lot of talk about what you’ll do in the first 100 days, about legislation. What will you actually do with these families? How will you care for them? Will they be detained or will they not be?",June
Cory Booker,"Well, this is a related and brief point because what we’re talking about, what Senator Castro and I are talking about, is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process. I have been to some of the largest private prisons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and their immigration lockups.",June
Cory Booker,"Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things, whether it’s immigration, whether it’s mental illness, whether it’s addiction, we know that this is not the way to deal with problems. There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solve this problem. Donald Trump isn’t solving this problem, we’ve seen under his leadership a surge at our border. We solve this problem by making investments in the northern triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place, and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care, to affirm the values of human dignity to people that come here because we cannot sacrifice our values, our ideals as a nation for border security. We can have both by doing this the right way.",June
Savannah,"All right, senator thank you. Let me go to Governor Inslee on this. What would you do on day one? Same question I just asked Cory Booker. I’m yet to hear an answer from anyone on this stage. What would you do with the families that will be here?",June
Jay Inslee,"There is no reason for the detention and separation of these children, they should be released pending their hearings, and they should have a hearing, and the law should be followed. That’s what should happen, and we should do what we’re doing in Washington state. I’m proud that we’ve passed a law that prevents local law enforcement from being turned into mini ICE agents. I am proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump’s heinous Muslim Ban. I’m proud to be a person who’s not only talked about dreamers, but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education so that they can realize their dreams. These are some of the most inspirational people in our state, and I’ll leave you with this thought if you want to know what I think.",June
Jay Inslee,"Donald Trump the other day, tried to threaten me. He thought it was a threat to tell me that he would send refugees in Washington state if we passed the law that I passed, and I told him that’s not a threat at all. We welcome refugees into our state. We recognize diversity as a strength. This is how we’ve built America, that tradition is going to continue if I’m president of the United States.",June
John Delaney,–,June
Lester Holt,"We’re going to switch to another topic now, we’ve got a lot to get through. Let’s talk  –",June
John Delaney,My grand father was actually separated from his family when he came to this country.,June
Lester Holt,"We’re going to talk about it but not right now because we’re going against the clock. Tankers have been attacked, the US drone has been shot down, there have been disturbing threats issued by both the US and Iranian leadership. I’d like if you can just for a moment to put aside how you think we may have gotten here, but what I want to know is how to get dial it back. So a show of hands, who’s president would sign onto the 2015 nuclear deal as it was originally negotiated? Well, Corey Booker, Senator Booker, why not?",June
Cory Booker,"May I address that? First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal, and one of the reasons why we’re seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation. Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years, and now we see around threatening to go further, and we’re being pulled in further and further into this crisis. We need to renegotiate and get back into a deal, but I’m not going to have a primary platform to say, “Unilaterally, I’m going to rejoin that deal,” because when I’m president of the United States, I’m going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal, I’m going to do it.",June
Lester Holt,"All right. Senator Klobuchar, I’d like you to answer that question because you said you would negotiate yourself back into the Iranian agreement. Can you argue that that new nuclear pact as it was ratified, was a good deal?",June
Cory Booker,"Yes, it was.",June
Amy Klobuchar,"It was imperfect, but it was a good deal for that moment. I would have worked to get longer sunset periods and that’s something we could negotiate to get back in the deal. But the point is, Donald Trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal. Those were his words. And now we are a month away from the Iranians who claim now that they’re going to blow the caps on enriching Iranian, and the Iranians have told us this. And so that’s where we are right now. He has made us less safe than we were, when he became president.",June
Amy Klobuchar,"What I would do is negotiate us back into that agreement, is stand with our allies and not give unlimited leverage to China and Russia, which is what he has done, and then finally, I would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict and we’re having this debate in Congress right now, that he comes to Congress for an authorization of military force, I would do that. And this president is literally every single day, 10 minutes away from going to war, one Tweet away from going to war, and I don’t think we should conduct foreign policy in our bathrobe at five in the morning .",June
Lester Holt,"Your time is up. Congresswoman Gabbard, you’ve said you would sign back on the 2015 deal. Would you insist though that it address Iran support for Hezbollah?",June
Tulsi Gabbard,"Let’s deal with the situation where we are, where this president and his chickenhawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with Iran. I served in the war in Iraq at the height of the war in 2005, a war that took over 4,000 of my brothers and sisters in uniforms, lives. The American people need to understand that this war with Iran would be far more devastating, far more costly than anything that we ever saw in Iraq. It would take many more lives. It would exacerbate the refugee crisis, and it wouldn’t be just contained within Iran, this would turn into a regional war.",June
Tulsi Gabbard,"This is why it’s so important that every one of us, every single American, stand up and say, “No war with Iran.” We need to get back into the Iran nuclear agreement and we need to negotiate how we can improve it. It was an imperfect deal. There issues like their missile development that needs to be addressed, we can do both simultaneously to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war.",June
Lester Holt,"Your time is up, and I have just a very quick follow-up, but what would your red line be? That would be for military action against Iran?",June
Tulsi Gabbard,"Obviously if there was an attack against the American, our troops, then there would have to be a response. But my point is, and it’s important for us to recognize this, is Donald Trump and his cabinet, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton and others, are creating a situation that just as spark would light off a war with Iran, which is incredibly dangerous. That’s why we need to deescalate tensions. Trump needs to get back into the Iran nuclear deal and swallow his pride. Put the American people first.",June
Savannah,"All right. We’re out of time. We’re up against a hard break, but we will have much more. Mayor De Blasio we’ll have more, the commercial is coming. We’ll continue our questioning next with Chuck Todd, Rachel Maddow, stick around. We’ll have a lot more with some very anxious candidates just ahead.",June

Speaker 26,"On election day 2020, Donald Trump will be something he was not on election day 2016. That is, president Donald Trump. Any incumbent running for reelection, in some ways, a reelection campaign for president, of course, becomes a referendum, and how folks feel the president did during his four years in office. So what can we say about how voters have been reacting so far to the Trump presidency? Well, what you see here, this is his average approval rating. Meaning you’ve always got these different polls out there, one day NBC will have one, the next day CNN will have one, they’re always coming in from all over the place. This trend line is an average, a day-to-day average of all of those polls put together.",June
Speaker 26,"And what you see here in this trend line, it’s a very narrow range that Trump is operating, and what I mean by that is, look at this. This is his high watermark, he’s peak as president. His average approval rating at its best, 46%. And when was this? Early February, 2017. That was his honeymoon. He had just become president. That makes him different right there, from every modern predecessor he has because all of them have gotten to 60, 65, 70% at least for a short period. They all had honeymoons. Trump’s honeymoon, he couldn’t even crack 50%, so already we see a lower ceiling for Trump than we’ve seen with past presidents, but that comes with a flip side and that is the basement for Trump.",June
Speaker 26,"Look at this. 37% is the low point he has hit in his average approval rating as president. That is actually not as low as some of his predecessors have gone. We’ve seen Nixon, Bush senior, Carter, we saw them fall into the 20s at some point during their term. That has not happened to Trump either. 37 on the low end, 46 on the high end right now, somewhere in between. It’s a very narrow range. It speaks to polarization. I’ll tell you, it speaks to something else. Is this presidency really any different politically in terms of how it’s being received than the campaign in 2016? Because compare this trend line, 46, 37 low high, compare that to Trump’s support against Hillary Clinton in the polls in the fall of 2016.",June
Speaker 26,"Trump’s average support at a low point 36%, at a high point about 43 and a half percent. Of course on election day, what was the number he hit? 46%, the same high water mark he has had in his approval rating. So Trump has been operating in the same range as a candidate. As president, we say it speaks to polarization. It also speaks to… Look, this is somebody who’ve succeeded as a candidate in 2016 despite some very, very high negative numbers. What I mean by that is, look at this, the exit poll on election day, Do you think Donald Trump’s qualified to be president? Only 38% said they thought he was qualified for the job. The clear majority said Trump wasn’t qualified. Does he have the temperament? 35% said he had the temperament. Do you like him? Do you have a favorable view? Only 40% did.",June
Speaker 26,"You’re not supposed to be able to win with those numbers. Trump was, one of the big reasons, his opponent. Hillary Clinton, by Election Day 2016, almost as unpopular as he was, only 43% favorable. It created that narrow path for Trump, and that becomes the question. When you look at that approval rating now in 2020, can he make his opponent as unpopular on election day as Clinton was in 16?",June

Chuck Todd,"To begin with, we’re going to go with guns, and Senator Warren, I want to start with you. We are less than 50 miles from Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last year, and where there has been significant activism on gun violence ever since.

Speaker 26,"All right, let’s take a look at the electoral college in 2020, the place to start obviously is where the last election ended, 2016. And remember, of course by the popular vote, Hillary Clinton had almost 3 million more of those than Donald Trump, but we don’t elect the president by national popular vote, we do it by the electoral college, and there Donald Trump had the right combination of votes in the right state enough to win 306 electoral votes for him.",June
Speaker 26,"How does that map looking for 2020? Well, first of all, I think one thing you need to do, just understand how narrow that Trump path was in the electoral college in 2016, you can start by looking at Wisconsin. Look at that margin there, fewer than 25,000 votes separated Clinton from Trump in Wisconsin. This was a state that had not gone for a Republican in a presidential election since 1984. By a margin of fewer than 25,000 votes, Trump becomes the first in over three decades he gets Wisconsin.",June
Speaker 26,"The margin in Michigan, even closer, barely 10,000 votes. Trump over Clinton again, as the first time since ’88 that Republican carried Michigan. And then there was Pennsylvania here about 44,000 votes. That’s the margin for Trump over Clinton in Pennsylvania. Trump wins all three of those states. Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, by a combined total of about 75,000 votes. That’s it. But that’s enough to win the electoral college. For Democrats, if they want to reverse the result of 2016 that is the easiest and most direct path, at least on paper. You flip those states where Trump’s margin was the narrowest, those states that had been voting democratic before 2016, you flip them back, you win the electoral college if everything else stays the same. That’s the most direct path for Democrats, at least on paper.",June
Speaker 26,"But Hey, things can change over the course of a few years. There are other states to be keeping an eye on as well. I’ll give you an example. Perfect one right here, Florida. We always talk about Florida, right, remember? Florida, Florida, Florida from back in 2000. Well, here’s one. Again, Donald Trump somewhat of a surprise on election night, I think the Clinton campaign had been feeling decent about Florida, but Trump pulled out Florida in 2016, 29 electoral votes right there, we obviously expect to be very competitive in 2020. If the Democrats can flip Florida, just given the size of the state, that is a massive change. The one cautionary note for Democrats though, they had a big year in the 2018 midterms, it was not big enough to carry over to Florida.",June
Speaker 26,"In Florida in the 2018 midterms, Republican won the governor’s race, Republican won the Senate race, ousted a democratic incumbent in fact, in that Senate race. Florida it’s tantalizing on paper for Democrats, it’s always tantalizing on paper for Democrats, but does 2018 tell you that maybe there’s a little bit more Republican strength there in Florida? And of course, Arizona is one Democrats had been talking about now. A long time red state that Democrats think demographically might be trending in their favor. This is a state Democrats did do well in the 2018 midterms, winning a Senate race there, Clinton got within three points. Democrats hope that there’s some momentum there, some demographics, some political momentum that could flip Arizona. That could change things too.",June

Speaker 30,"If you fight for what’s right, you can change the world.",June
Chuck Todd,We believe we have the technical difficulties  –,June
Rachel Maddow,Never say that.,June
Chuck Todd,"Never say never, but we will march forward here and I will lean forward here a little bit. Senator Warren, we’re going to get to the gun question here. Parkland, Florida, it’s just north of here in Broward County. As you know, it has created a lot of teenage activism on the gun issue. It has inspired a lot of you to come out with more robust plans to deal with guns, including Assault Weapons Ban, but even if you were able to implement that, what do you do about the hundreds of millions of guns already out there, and as a federal government, have to play a role in dealing with it?",June
Elizabeth W.,"In this period of time that I’ve been running for president, I’ve had more than a 100 town halls, I’ve taken more than 2000 unfiltered questions, and the single hardest question I’ve gotten, I got one from a little boy and I got one from a little girl. And that is to say, when you’re president, how are you going to keep us safe? That’s our responsibility as adults. Seven children will die today from gun violence, children and teenagers, and they won’t just die in mass shootings, they’ll die on sidewalks, they’ll die in playgrounds, they’ll die in people’s backyards, gun violence is a national health emergency in this country and we need to treat it like that.",June
Elizabeth W.,"So what can we do? We can do the things that are sensible. We can do the universal background checks, we can ban the weapons of war, but we can also double down on the research and find out what really works, where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe. We need to treat this like the virus that’s killing our children.",June
Chuck Todd,"Okay, thank you Senator Warren. You didn’t address… do you think the federal government needs to go and figure out a way to get the guns that are already out there?",June
Elizabeth W.,"What I think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem, which we have not done.",June
Chuck Todd,Okay.,June
Elizabeth W.,"Guns in the hands of a collector who’s had them for decades, who’s never fired, who take safety seriously, that’s very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly. We can’t treat this as an across the board problem, we have to treat it like a public health emergency. That means, bring data to bear and it means making real change in this country, whether it’s politically popular or not. We need to fight for our children.",June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you Senator. Senator Booker, you have a federal government buy back program in your plan. How is that going to work?",June
Cory Booker,"Well, first of all, I want to say my colleague and I both have been hearing this on the campaign trail, but what’s even worse is I hear gunshots in my neighborhood. I think I’m the only one, I hope I’m the only one on this panel here, that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week. Someone I knew, Shahade Smith, was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year.",June
Cory Booker,"For millions of Americans, this is not a policy issue, this is an urgency. And for those who have not been directly affected, they’re tired of living in a country where their kids go to school to learn about reading, writing, and arithmetic, and how to deal with an active shooter in their school. This is something that I’m tired of, and I’m tired of hearing people all they have to offer is thoughts and prayers. In my faith, people say faith without works is dead. So we will find a way, but the reason we have a problem right now is we’ve let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate. It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda. I will get that done as president of United States because this is not about policy, this is personal.",June
Chuck Todd,Thank you Senator Booker.,June
Rachel Maddow,"Secretary Castro, I’d like to talk to you about something that Senator Booker just mentioned there, the idea of active shooter drills in schools. The school shooting seem like an almost everyday or every week occurrence, now they don’t make a complete news cycle anymore no matter the death toll as parents are so afraid as their kids go off to school that their kids will be caught up in something like this. Next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings. Is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes or is there something that you would do as president that you really think would turn it around?",June
Julián Castro,"01 PM, we’re going to have a democratic president, a democratic house, and a democratic Senate.",June
Julián Castro,"The activists of Parkland, folks from Moms Demand, who’ve risen up across the United States and inspired so many people, we may not have seen yet legislative action, but we’re getting closer. The house took a vote in the Senate. The question often is, if the decision is between 60 votes of filibuster or passing common-sense gun reform? I’m going to choose common-sense gun reform. I believe that we’re going to be able to get that done in 2021.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Secretary Castro, thank you.",June
Tim Ryan,"Rachel, I have something to add to this briefly because  –",June
Rachel Maddow,"30 seconds for follow-up on that question, on that answer from Secretary Castro, Congressman Ryan.",June
Tim Ryan,"You’re talking about in the schools, these kids are traumatized. I support all the gun reforms here. We need to start dealing with the trauma that our kids have. We need trauma-based care in every school, we need social and emotional learning in every school, 90% of the shooters who do school shootings come from the school they’re in, and 73% of them feel shamed, traumatized, or bullied. We need to make sure that these kids feel connected to the school, that means a mental health counselor in every single school in the United States, we need to start playing offense. If our kids are so traumatized that they’re getting a gun and going into our schools, we’re doing something wrong too, and we need reform around trauma-based care.",June
Rachel Maddow,Thank you congressman Ryan.,June
Chuck Todd,"Congressman O’Rourke, Texans campaign, you can’t be in all of the state in 2018, and the most conservative parts there, what do you tell a gun owner who may agree with you on everything else but says, “You know what? The Democrats, if I vote for him in there, they’re going to take my gun away. And even though I agree with you on like these other issues, I can’t.” How do you have that conversation?",June
Beto O’Rourke,"Here’s how we had that conversation in Texas. I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe High School shooting, a young student named Bree. Her friend Marcel who survived another shooting, the mother of a victim who lost her life, Rhonda Hart, they talked about universal background checks where you close every loophole, we know that they save lives, talks about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities. Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible, they should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities.",June
Beto O’Rourke,"Red flag law, so if someone causes danger to themselves or to someone else, they’re stopped before it’s too late. And what I’ve found in each one of those 254 counties is that Democrats and Independents and Republicans, gun owners and non gun owners alike, agreed. But this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue. Those students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas led the charge here in Florida, and they’ve been able to change those laws. They’re making our democracy work, ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass.",June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you, Congressman O’Rourke. Hang on, let me give 30 seconds to Senator Klobuchar, the iron range. I’m curious. Gun confiscation, if the government is buying back, how do you not have that conversation?",June
Amy Klobuchar,"Well, that’s not confiscation.",June
Chuck Todd,Right.,June
Amy Klobuchar,"You give them the offer to buy back their gun. But I will say this, I look at these proposals and I say, “Does this hurt my uncle Dick and his gear stand coming from a proud hunting and fishing state?” These proposals don’t do that. When I was a prosecutor, I supported the Assault Weapon Ban. When I was in the Senate, I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change and we all failed. And then now these Parkland kids from Florida, they started a literally a national shift. You know why? It’s just like with gay marriage. When kids talk to their parents and their grandparents and say, “I don’t understand why we can’t put these sensible things in place,” they listen. And if we get pestered by much of 17 year olds, it’s the best thing that ever happen. We need to get this done.",June
Chuck Todd,"Senator, thank you.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Booker, let me go to you on another  actually. Dr Senator Mitch McConnell says that his most consequential achievement as Senate majority leader was preventing President Obama from filling a supreme court seat, having served with Republicans on the judiciary committee, do you believe they would confirm your court nominees?",June
Cory Booker,"I’m going to use 20 my seconds just to say, there’s one thing we don’t all agree with when it comes to guns, and I think it’s common sense, and over 70% of Americans agree with me. If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and own a firearm. And not everybody in this field agrees with that, but in states like Connecticut they did that, they saw 40% drops in gun violence and 15% drops in suicides. We need to start having bold agendas on guns.",June
Cory Booker,"When it comes to the Supreme Court, very clearly we… I agree with my friend, Secretary Castro, we are going to get to 50 votes in the Senate. This is a team support. Whoever is our nominee, needs the campaign in places like South Carolina because we can elect Jaime Harrison. They need to campaign in places like Iowa because we can win the Senate sit there. This is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the Senate and more, so that we can not only balance the supreme court but start to pass an aggressive agenda that frankly isn’t so aggressive because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Mayor De Blasio,  –",June
Rachel Maddow,"Congressman Delaney, you’ll have some time in a moment on this issue. Congressman Delaney, I’ll give you some time in a moment.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Mayor De Blasio, as an executive in the largest city in this country, you are used to saying what you want to have happen and having it happen. If you nominate a supreme court nominee as president of the United States and Mitch McConnell is still Senate majority leader, what makes you believe that he would allow you to make a nominee?",June
Bill De Blasio,"Rachel? I am chief executive of the nation’s largest city, and I also want to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question. Look, I run the largest police force in America too, and if we’re going to stop these shootings, and we want to get these guns off the street, we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community. I also want to say, there’s something that sets me apart from all my colleagues running in this race and that is, for the last 21 years I’ve been raising a black son in America, and I have had to have very, very serious talks with my son, Dante, about how to protect himself on the streets of our city and all over this country, including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there’ve been too many tragedies between our young men and our police too, as we saw recently in Indiana.",June
Bill De Blasio,"So we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns, but also a different conversation about policing that brings police and community together. We’ve done that in New York City and we’ve driven down crime while we’ve done it. But to your question about Mitch McConnell, there’s a political solution that we have to come to grips with. If the Democratic Party would stop acting like the party of the elites and be the party of working people again and go into states, including red states, to convince people we’re on their side, we can put pressure on their senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that have put forward  –",June
Chuck Todd,"I’m going to get you 30 seconds, I promise. Let me get this question. We’re trying, I know you guys, we got other issues we’re trying to get to including a big one coming up in a minute, but Senator Warren, I want to continue on the Mitch McConnell thing because you have a lot of ambitious plans.",June
Elizabeth W.,I do.,June
Chuck Todd,"You have a plan for that. Okay. We talked about the Supreme Court. Do you ever plan to deal with Mitch McConnell if you don’t beat him in the Senate? If he’s still sitting there as the Senate majority leader, it’s very plausible you’d be getting elected president with a Republican Senate. Do you have a plan to deal with Mitch McConnell?",June
Elizabeth W.,"I do. We’re democracy, and the way our democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters. Now we for far too long have had a congress in Washington that has just completely dismissed what people care about across this country. They have made this country work much better for those who can make giant contributions, made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and not made it work for the people.",June
Elizabeth W.,"Well, here’s how I see this happening. Number one short, I want to see us get a democratic majority in the Senate, but short of the Democratic majority in the Senate, you better understand the fight still goes on. It starts in the White House and it means that everybody we energize in 2020, stays on the front lines come January, 2021. We have to push from the outside, have leadership from the inside, and make this congress reflect will of the people.",June
Chuck Todd,"Okay, I’m going to get a couple of you in here. I’m going to get a couple of you in here, 30 seconds.",June
Chuck Todd,"Congressman Delaney, you seem to believe you can do everything in a bipartisan manner. Mitch McConnell doesn’t operate that way, he operates differently. Why do you think he is going to conform to your style?",June
John Delaney,"I think we need to get things done. That’s why I believe we need to operate in a bipartisan manner. Listen, I’ll sign into law, bills that come to the White House that are passed on a party line basis, absolutely. But all the big transformative things we’ve ever done in this country’s history have happened when huge majorities of the American people get behind them, which is why we need real solutions, not impossible promises. We need to put forth ideas to work, whether it’s on healthcare, creating universal healthcare so that every American gets health care, but not running on making private insurance illegal. The gun issue is related, the gun safety issue is related, because I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been with folks in western Maryland and they’ve said to me, “Democrats don’t do anything for us. Republicans don’t do anything for us. You fight all the time,” so they vote on that single issue.",June
Chuck Todd,"Okay, thank you Congressman.",June
John Delaney,"If we become the party of getting things done for the American people, with real sources not impossible promises, we’ll be able to all these things done.",June
Chuck Todd,"Senator Booker, 30 seconds. How do you deal with Mitch McConnell? You’ve been in the Senate, you can’t get bills on the floor right now with Mitch McConnell. Presidents can’t do it. Is President Booker going to get his bills on the floor with Senator McConnell?",June
Cory Booker,"When I got to the United States Senate, going back to what De Blasio said, as an African American man and an African American dominated community, I knew one of the biggest issue was criminal justice reform. From police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more African Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850, and when I got to the Senate, people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done.",June
Cory Booker,"As my colleagues in the Senate know, I fought on that bill from the day I got to the Senate, build coalitions across the aisle, and today we passed the first step Act. It’s not as far as I want to go, but thousands of people will be liberated. I’ve taken on top problems people said we cannot achieve and I’ve been able to get things accomplished.",June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you, Senator Booker. Rachel has got the next question.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Governor, you’re going to be happy with where we go. Governor Inslee, the next question is to you. You got me? You got me? You have state your candidacy on the issue of climate change. It is the first, second and third priority for you. You’ve said it’s all the issues. Let’s get specific. We’re here in Miami which is already experiencing serious flooding on sunny days as a result of sea level rise, parts of Miami beach and the keys could be underwater in our lifetimes. Does your plan save Miami?",June
Jay Inslee,"Yes. First by taking away the filibuster for Mitch McConnell to start with, we have to do that. We’re the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we are the last that can do something about it. Our towns are burning, our fields are flooding, Miami’s inundated. We have to understand this is a climate crisis and emergency and it is our last chance in the new administration, next one to do something about it, and we need to do what I’ve done in my state.",June
Jay Inslee,"We’ve passed a 100% clean electrical grid bill, we now have a vision statement, and my plan has been called the gold standard of putting people to work. But the most important thing on this, and the biggest decision for the American public is, who’s going to make this the first priority? And I am the candidate and the only one who’s saying this has to be the top priority of the United States, the organizing principle to mobilize United States so that we can do what we’ve always done, lead the world and invent the future and put 8 million people to work. That’s what we’re going to do.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Governor Inslee, thank you.",June
Chuck Todd,"Congressman O’Rourke, you’ve also put out a big climate change plan from your campaign. You want some big changes in a pretty short period of time, including switching to a renewable energy, pushing to replace gas powered cars in favor of electric ones. What’s your message to a voter who supports the overall goal of what you’re trying to do, but suddenly it feels as if government’s telling them how to live and ordering them how to live? What is that balance like?",June
Beto O’Rourke,"I think you’ve got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face. That’s why we’re traveling everywhere listening to everyone. We were in a Pacific Junction, a town that had never meaningly flooded before, just up against some Missouri River in Iowa, and every home in that community had flooded. There were farms just outside of Pacific Junction that were affectively lakes, those farmers are already underwater in debt, their markets close to them by a trade war under this administration and now they don’t know what to do. We in our administration are going to fund resiliency in those communities in Miami, in Houston, Texas, those places that are on the front lines of climate change today.",June
Beto O’Rourke,"We’re going to mobilize $5 trillion in this economy over the next 10 years. We’re going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and we’re going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver’s seat renewable and sustainable agriculture to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil, paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide. If all of us does all that we can, then we’re going to be able to keep this planet from warming another two degrees celsius, and ensure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise and our potential.",June
Chuck Todd,"30 seconds, Secretary Castro. Who pays for the mitigation to climate? Whether it’s building sea walls… For people that are perhaps living in places that they shouldn’t be living, is this a federal government issue that needs to do that? Do they have to move these people? What do you do about that where maybe they’re building a house someplace that isn’t safe? Who pays to build that house and how much should the government be bailing them out?",June
Julián Castro,"Well, I don’t think that that represents the vast majority of the issue. In fact, my first visit after I announced my candidacy wasn’t to Iowa and New Hampshire, it was to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Because people should know that if I’m elected president everybody will count. I’m one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience with a track record of getting things done. When I was mayor of San Antonio, we moved our local public utility. We began to shift it from coal fired plants to solar and other renewables, and also created more than 800 jobs doing that. And when I was HUD secretary, we worked on the national disaster resilience competition to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way.",June
Julián Castro,"That’s the way that we’re going to help make sure that we’re all safe in the years to come and that we combat climate change. And if I’m elected president, the first thing that I would do, like Senator Klobuchar also said, is sign an executive order recommitting us to the Paris Climate Accord so that we can  –",June
Chuck Todd,"Congressman Ryan, I got a full question for you here, which is simply this. A lot of the climate plans include pricing carbon, taxing carbon in some way. This type of proposal has been tried in a few places, whether it’s Washington state where voters voted it down. You’ve had the Yellow Vest Movement. We had in Australia, one party get rejected out of fear of the cost of climate change, sort of being put on the backs of the consumer. If pricing carbon, it’s just politically impossible, how do we pay for climate mitigation?",June
Tim Ryan,"Well, there’s a variety of different ways to pay. We talk about different ways of raising revenue and I think we’ve got to build our way out of this and grow our way out of this. But let me just talk real quick to the previous question about real politics. We could talk about climate, we could talk about guns, we could talk about all of these issues that we all care about. We have a perception problem with the Democratic Party.",June
Tim Ryan,"We are not connecting to the working class people in the very states that I represent in Ohio, in the industrial Midwest. We’ve lost all connection. That we have got to change the center of gravity of the Democratic Party from being coastal and elitists and Ivy League, which is the perception to somebody from the forgotten communities that have been left behind for the last 30 years, to get those workers back on our side. So we can say we’re going to build electric vehicles, we’re going to build solar panels, but if you want to beat Mitch McConnell, this better be a working class party. If you want to go into Kentucky and take his rear end out, and if you want to take Lindsay Graham out, you got to have a blue collar party that can go into the textile communities in South Carolina.",June
Tim Ryan,"All I’m saying here is, if we don’t address that fundamental problem with our connection to workers, white, black, brown, gay, straight, working class people, none of this is going to get done.",June
Chuck Todd,Thank you very much. We’re going to keep moving  –,June
John Delaney,I introduced the only bipartisan carbon tax bill  –,June
Chuck Todd,"30 seconds, go.",June
John Delaney,"All the economists agree that a carbon pricing mechanism works. You just have to do it right. You can’t put a price on carbon, raise energy prices and not give the money back to the American people. My proposal, which is put a price on carbon, give a dividend back to the American people, it goes out one pocket back in the other, I can get that passed my first year as president with a coalition of every Democrat in the congress and the Republicans who live in coastal states. Republicans in Florida, they actually care about this issue. This has got to be our way forward if we’re actually serious about this issue.",June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you. Congresswoman Gabbard. We’re going to move here. One of the first things you did after launching your campaign was to issue an apology to the LGBTQ community about your past stances and statements on gay rights. After the Trump administration’s rollbacks of civil rights protections for many in that community, why should voters in that community or voters that care about this issue in general, trust you now?",June
Tulsi Gabbard,"Well, let me say that there is no one in our government at any level who has the right to tell any American who they should be allowed to love or who they should be allowed to marry. My record in Congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for LGBTQ equality. I serve on the equality caucus and recently voted for passage of the Equality Act. Maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that I grew up in a socially conservative home held views when I was very young that I no longer hold today.",June
Tulsi Gabbard,"I’ve served with LGBTQ service members both in training and deployed down range. I know that they would give their life for me and I would give my life for them. It is this commitment that I’ll carry through as president of the United States, recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace. Still people who are unable to find a home for their families. It is this kind of discrimination that we need to address.",June
Cory Booker,But it’s not enough.,June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you, Congresswoman.",June
Cory Booker,"If I can add to this, it’s very important.",June
Chuck Todd,"But 30 seconds, Senator.",June
Cory Booker,"Look, civil rights is some place to begin, but in the African American civil rights community, another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of African Americans. We do not talk enough about Trans Americans, especially African American Trans Americans, and the incredibly high rates of murder right now. We don’t talk enough about how many children, about 30% of LGBTQ kids, who do not go to school because of fear. It’s not enough just to be on the Equality Act, I’m an original co-sponsor. We need to have a president that will fight to protect LGBTQ Americans every single day from violence in our country.",June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you, Senator Booker.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Klobuchar, let me put this to you, on the issue of civil rights and demographics, honestly, and politics. For decades, the Democratic Party has counted on African American voter turnout as step one to winning elections on a national level. Democrats are counting on the Latino community now and in the future in the same way. What have you done for black and Latino voters that should enthuse them about going to the polls for you if you’re in your party’s nominee?",June
Amy Klobuchar,"My life and my career and my work in the Senate has been about economic opportunity, and to me this means better childcare for everyone in this country. And when you want to have an economy that works, you need to have retirement that works. You need to have public schools that work. And you also need to make sure that those communities are able to get those jobs of the future, the stem jobs. In fact, Donald Trump, one of the first bills that he signed of the 34 he signed, where I was the lead Democrat… Okay, that’s a first step here, I was one that was about that. Making sure minority community members could share in those jobs.",June
Amy Klobuchar,"So to me, this is about a few things. It’s about an African American woman that goes to a hospital in New Orleans, says her hands are swollen and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies. It’s about the fact that African American women make 61 cents for every $1 a white man makes. So in short, we need to one, and I will do this in my first a 100 days as president, we will work to make sure everyone can vote at this table. Everyone can vote in this country, and we will also go to the next step of criminal justice reform. Senator Booker and I, worked on that first step Act, but we should go to the second step Act, which is to help all our communities  –",June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator, thank you very much. 30 seconds follow-up to you. Secretary Castro, this is a 70% Latino city here in Miami. You were the only Latino Democrat who was running this year in the presidential race. Is that enough of an answer, what Senator Klobuchar is describing there, an economic justice agenda. Is that enough to mobilize Latino voters to stand with the Democratic Party in a big way?",June
Julián Castro,"Oh, well I also think that we have to recognize racial and social justice. I was in Charleston not too long ago and I remembered that Dylann Roof went to the Mother Emanuel AME Church and he murdered nine people who were worshiping, and then he was apprehended by police without incident. Well, but what about Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and Laquan McDonald and Sandra Bland and Pamela Turner, and Antonio Arce?",June
Julián Castro,"I’m proud that I’m the only candidate so far that has put forward legislation that would reform our policing system in America and make sure that no matter what the color of your skin is, that you’re treated the same including Latinos who are mistreated too, oftentimes by police.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Secretary Castro, thank you.",June
Chuck Todd,"Let me go over to Lester Holt, who’s got a question, I believe a viewer question.",June
Lester Holt,"I’m over here, Chuck. Thanks. We ask our voters from across the country to submit their questions to the candidates. Let me read one now. This comes from John in New York who’ve submitted this question. He asks, “Does the United States have a responsibility to protect? In the case of genocide or crimes against humanity, do we have a responsibility to intervene to protect people threatened by their governments even when atrocities do not affect American core interests?” I’d like to direct that question to Congressman O’Rourke.",June
Beto O’Rourke,"John, I appreciate the question. The answer is yes, but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends. When the United States presents a United front, we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer, the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda, the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward.",June
Beto O’Rourke,"But unfortunately under this administration, president Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances, he has diminished our standing in the world and he’s made us weaker as a country less able to confront challenges, whether it’s Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia, who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016 and who president Trump has offered another invitation to do the same.",June
Beto O’Rourke,"He’s embraced strongmen and dictators at the expense of the great democracies. As president, I will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy. I will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together, that makes America stronger.",June
Bill De Blasio,What about the War Powers Act?,June
Rachel Maddow,"Congressman O’Rourke, thank you.",June
Bill De Blasio,"What about the War Powers Act being a part of that equation with deep respect to the congressman? Look, we’ve learned painful lessons as Americans that we’ve gone to war without congressional authorization. Look, this is very personal for me. I know the cost of war. My Dad served in the Pacific in World War II, in the US Army, Battle of Okinawa, had half his leg blown off, and he came home with scars, both physical and emotional and he did not recover. He spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life.",June
Bill De Blasio,"That battle didn’t kill him, but that war did. And look even in the humanitarian crisis, and I think we should be ready, congressman, to intervene. God forbid there is a genocide, but not without congressional approval. Democrats and Republicans, both in the Congress have not challenged presidents, and have let them get away with running the military without the congressional approval. We learned the lesson in Vietnam, we seem to have forgotten. The decisions have to be made by the United States Congress in the name of the people.",June
Rachel Maddow,"I’m gong to pick up this point, and I want to put this to Congressman Ryan. Today, the Taliban claimed responsibility for killing two American service members in Afghanistan. Leaders as disparate as President Obama and president Trump have both said that they want to end US involvement in Afghanistan, but it isn’t over for America. Why isn’t it over? Why can’t presidents of very different parties and very different temperaments get us out of there, and how could you?",June
Tim Ryan,"I appreciate that question. I’ve been in Congress 17 years and 12 of those years, I’ve sat on the Armed Services Committee, the Defense Appropriations Committee, or the Armed Services Committee. And the lesson that I’ve learned over the years is that you have to stay engaged in these situations. Nobody likes it, it’s long, it’s tedious, but right now we have… I would say, we must be engaged in this. We must have our State Department engaged, we must have our military engaged to the extent they need to be, but the reality of it is this president doesn’t even have people appointed in the State Department to deal with these things. Whether we’re talking about Central America, whether we’re talking about Iran, whether we’re talking about Afghanistan, we’ve got to be completely engaged, and here’s why.",June
Tim Ryan,"Because these flareups distract us from the real problems in the country. If getting a drone shot down for $130 million, because the president is distracted, that’s $130 million that we could be spending in places like Youngstown, Ohio, or Flint, Michigan, or rebuilding –",June

Tulsi Gabbard,"Is that what you will tell the parents of those two soldiers who were just killed in Afghanistan? Well, we just have to be engaged. As a soldier, I will tell you that answer is unacceptable. We have to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. We’re in a place in Afghanistan where we have lost so many lives, we’ve spent so much money, money that’s coming out of every one of our pockets, money that should be going into communities here at home, meeting the needs of the people here at home. We are no better off in Afghanistan today than we were when this war began. This is why it’s so important to have a president and commander-in-chief who knows the cost of war, and who’s ready to do the job on day one. I am ready to do that job when I walk into the  –",June

Tim Ryan,"I would just say, I don’t want to be engaged, I wish we were spending all this money in places that I’ve represented that have been completely forgotten and we were rebuilding. But the reality of it is if the United States isn’t engaged, the Taliban will grow and they would have bigger, bolder, terrorist acts. We have got to have some present there  –",June

Chuck Todd,"Congressman O’Rourke, special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, outlines multiple instances of potential criminal behavior by president Trump. How Speaker Pelosi has publicly and privately resisted any move toward impeachment in the House, if the House chooses not to impeach, as president, would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in Mr. Mueller’s report?",June
Beto O’Rourke,"Yes, and I’ll tell you why.",June
Chuck Todd,"How, by the way, if the answer is yes?",June
Beto O’Rourke,"One of the most powerful pieces of art in the United States capital is the Trumbull painting of General George Washington resigning his commission to the Continental Congress, at the height of his power, submitting to the rule of law in the will of people. That has withstood the test of time for the last 243 years.",June
Beto O’Rourke,"If we set in other precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power, a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy, if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity, then we will have set a new standard. And that is, that some people, because of the position of power and public trust that they hold, are above the law and we cannot allow that to stand.",June
Beto O’Rourke,"We must begin impeachment now so that we have the facts and the truth, and we follow them as far as they go and as high up as they reach, and we saved this democracy. And if we’ve not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows in under my administration, our department of Justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences, there is accountability, and there is justice. It’s the only way that we’ll saved this country.",June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you, Congressman O’Rourke.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Congressman Delaney, because of the accountability issues that Congressman O’Rourke was just describing there, and the real political landscape in which Nancy Pelosi is saying that impeachment will not be pursued in the House, it raises the prospect and the Mueller report raises the prospect that president Trump could be prosecuted for some of those potential crimes down the line. No US president has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office. Do you believe that president Trump could or should be the first?",June

Monday, February 3rd, the race begins in Iowa and then traditionally it is an eight day stretch from Iowa to New Hampshire. First caucuses in Iowa, first primary in New Hampshire eight days later, so you can expect however many candidates are left when they get to the starting line in Iowa, there’s probably going to be far fewer eight days later between Iowa and New Hampshire. You can expect a lot of winnowing to take place, you’ll have some clear candidates who are out in front as well.",June

And then the big one, obviously, the South Carolina primary, the first in the south primary at the end of the month and of course South Carolina, very important because this is the first day we’re going to have a really substantial black population voting 60%, more than 60%, of the democratic electorate in the 2016 South Carolina Primary, was African American.

You’ve got California, you got Texas, you’ve got a bunch in the south, you’ve got Massachusetts, Minnesota, all of these states all at once.

It matters that we choose someone who saw the wasted potential of our children, denied pre-K and gave it to every single one of them for free. These things really matter and these are the things that I’ve done in New York and I want to do the same for this whole country, because putting working people first, it matters.

I have won every place, every race, and every time, I have won in the reddest of districts, ones that Donald Trump won by over 20 points. I can win in states like Wisconsin and Iowa and in Michigan.

By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn’t have the money for college application, much less a chance for me to go to college, but I got my chance, it was a $50 a semester commuter college.

Savannah G.,Senator Sanders. Good evening to you.,June
Savannah G.,"You’ve called for big new government benefits, like universal healthcare and free college. In a recent interview you said you suspected that Americans would be “delighted” to pay more taxes for things like that. My question to you is, will taxes go up for the middle class in a Sanders administration, and if so, how do you sell that to voters?",June
Bernie Sanders,"Okay. Well, you’re quite right. We have a new vision for America. And at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today, we think it is time for change, real change. And by that I mean that healthcare, in my view, is a human right and we have got to pass a Medicare for All, single payer system.",June
Bernie Sanders,"Under that system, by the way, vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now.",June
Bernie Sanders,"I believe that education is the future for this country, and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition free and eliminate student debt, and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street.",June
Bernie Sanders,Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for.,June

Savannah G.,"Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders, as you know, has been calling for a revolution. Recently in remarks to a group of wealthy donors, as you were speaking about the problem of income inequality in this country, you said we shouldn’t “demonize the rich.” You said nobody has to be punished, no one’s standard of living would change, nothing would fundamentally change. What did you mean by that?",June
Joe Biden,"What I meant by that is, look, Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America. Ordinary middle class Americans built American. My dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joe, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything’s going to be okay.”",June
Joe Biden,"Too many people who are in the middle class and poor, have had the bottom fall out under this proposal. What I’m saying is that we’ve got to be straight forward. We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class, they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it. They have to make sure that we are in a situation where there’s continuing education and they’re able to pay for it, and they have to make sure that they’re able to breathe air that is clean and they have water that they can drink.",June
Joe Biden,"Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation, we do have enormous income inequality. The one thing I agree on is we can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there, and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy.",June
Savannah G.,"Vice President Biden, thank you.",June
Savannah G.,"Senator Harris, there’s a lot talk in this primary about new government benefits, such as student loan cancellation, free college, healthcare, and more. Do you think that Democrats have a responsibility to explain how they will pay for every proposal they make along those lines?",June
Kamala Harris,"Well, let me tell you something. I hear that question, but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top 1%, and the biggest corporations in this country, contributing at least $1 trillion to the debt of America, which middle class families will pay for one way or another.",June
Kamala Harris,"Working families need support and need to be lifted up, and frankly, this economy is not working for working people. For too long, the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most, and not in favor of the people who work the most, which is why I am proposing that we change the tax code.",June
Kamala Harris,"So for every family that is making less than $100,000 a year, they will receive a tax credit that they can collect $500 a month, which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and with support, or not. And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1%, and the biggest corporations of America.",June
Savannah G.,"Senator Harris, thank you.",June
Savannah G.,"Governor Hickenlooper, let me get you in on this. You’ve warned that Democrats will lose in 2020 if they embrace socialism, as you put it. You were booed at the California Democratic Convention when you said that. Only one candidate on this stage, Senator Sanders, identifies himself as a Democratic socialist. What are the policies or positions of your opponents that you think are veering towards socialism?",June
John H.,"Well, I think that the bottom line is if we don’t clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and call us socialists, and if you look at the Green New Deal, which I admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change, I’m a scientist, but we can’t promise every American a government job. If you want to get universal healthcare coverage, I believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege, but you can’t expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many of whom don’t want to give it up.",June
John H.,"In Colorado, we brought businesses and nonprofits together. We got near universal healthcare coverage. We were the first state in America to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address, aggressively address, methane emissions, and we were also the first place to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis and we reduced teen pregnancy by 54%. We’ve done the big progressive things that people said couldn’t be done. I’ve done what pretty much everyone else up here is still talking about doing.",June
Savannah G.,"All right Governor, thank you.",June
Savannah G.,"Senator Sanders, I’ll give you a chance to weigh in here. What is your response to those who say nominating a socialist would re-elect Donald Trump?",June
Bernie Sanders,"Well, I think the responses at the polls, the last poll I saw has us 10 points ahead of Donald Trump because the American people understand that Trump is a phony, that Trump is a pathological liar and a racist, and that he lied to the American people during his campaign.",June
Bernie Sanders,"He said he was going to stand up for working families, well President Trump, you’re not standing up for working families when you try to throw 32 million people off their healthcare that they have, and that 83% of your tax benefits go to the top 1%. That’s how we beat Trump. We expose him for the fraud that he is.",June

Kirsten G.,"If you’re talking about ending gun violence, it’s the greed of the NRA and the gun manufacturers that make any progress possible. It’s the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies, when we want to try to get healthcare as a right and not a privilege.",June
Savannah G.,"Senator Gillibrand, thank you.",June
Kirsten G.,"So there need not be disagreement in the party, because in truth, we want healthy capitalism.",June
Savannah G.,"Senator, thank you.",June
Kirsten G.,We don’t want corrupted capitalism-,June
Savannah G.,"Thank you, I want to be fair to all the candidates.",June
Kirsten G.,… which is the definition of greed.,June
Savannah G.,Thank you.,June
Savannah G.,"Senator Bennett, you have said, “It’s possible to write policy proposals that have no basis in reality, you might as well call them candy.” Were you referring to any candidate or proposal in particular when you said that?",June
Bennett,Was that directed to me?,June
Savannah G.,"Yes, that was your quote.",June
Bennett,"Oh, thank you. That sounded like me. Thank you.",June
Savannah G.,It was you.,June
Bennett,I appreciate it.,June
Bennett,"Well look, first of all, I agree completely with Bernie about what the fundamental challenge we’re facing as a country is. 40 years of no economic growth for 90% of the American people, 160,000 families in the top 0.1% have the same wealth as the bottom 90%, and we’ve got the worst income inequality that we’ve had in 100 years.",June
Bennett,"Where I disagree is on his solution on Medicare for All. You know, I have proposed getting to universal healthcare, which we need to do, it is a right. Healthcare is a right. We need to get to universal healthcare. I believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with Obamacare and creating a public option, that every family and every person in America can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option, which for them would be like having Medicare for All, or whether they want to keep their private insurance.",June
Bennett,I believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that.,June
Bennett,.,June
Bennett,"Bernie … If I could just finish. Bernie mentioned that the taxes that we would have to pay, because of those taxes, Vermont rejected Medicare for All, and we shouldn’t be .",June

Speaker 2,I understand-,June
Jose,"Before we do, I want to say hello and good evening, beunas noches to Mayor Buttigieg.",June
Pete Buttigieg,Beunas noches. .,June
Jose,.,June
Jose,"Many of your colleagues on stage support free college. You do not, why not?",June
Pete Buttigieg,Sure. College affordability is personal for us. Chasten and I have six figure student debt.,June
Pete Buttigieg,"I believe in reducing student debt. It’s logical to me that if you can refinance your house, you ought to be able to refinance your student debt. I also believe in free college for low and middle income students for whom cost could be a barrier.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"I just don’t believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize, even the children of billionaires. I think the children of the wealthiest Americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition, and while I want tuition cost to go down, I don’t think we can buy down every last penny for them.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"Now, there’s something else that doesn’t get talked about in the college affordability debate. Yes, it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college. It also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college. You should be able to live well, afford rent, be generous to your church and little league, whether you went to college or not. That’s one of many reasons we need to raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour.",June
Eric Stalwell,"Jose, I’ve got $100,000 in student loan debt myself.",June
Jose,Let me get to you in a-,June
Eric Stalwell,"Let me tell you, we count on the people who’ve been in government for the last 30 years, who were around when this problem was created to be the ones to solve it. It’s going to be the next generation, the 40 million of us, who can’t start a family, can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home. This is the generation that’s going to be able to solve student loan debt, this generation is ready to lead.",June
Jose,"Mr. Yang, your signature policy is to give every adult in the United States $1,000 a month. No questions asked.",June
Andrew Yang,That’s right.,June
Jose,I think that’s like $3.2 trillion a year. How would you do that?,June
Andrew Yang,I’m sorry?,June
Jose,How would you do that?,June
Andrew Yang,"Oh, so it’s difficult to do if you have companies like Amazon, trillion dollar tech companies paying literally zero in taxes, while they’re closing 30% of our stores.",June
Andrew Yang,"Now, we need to put the American people in a position to benefit from all these innovations in other parts of the economy, and if we had a value added tax at even half the European level, it would generate over $800 billion in new revenue, which combined with the money in our hands, it would be the trickle up economy from our people, families and communities up. We would spend the money and it would circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods, creating millions of jobs, making our families stronger and healthier.",June
Andrew Yang,"We’d save money on things like incarceration, homelessness services, emergency room healthcare. And just the value gains from having a stronger, healthier, mentally healthier population would increase GDP by $700 billion. This is the move that we have to make, particularly as technology is now automating away millions of American jobs. It’s why Donald Trump is our President today, that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And we’re about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs, call center jobs, fast food jobs, truck driving jobs, and on and on through the account.",June
Jose,"So, if I get you … understand a little bit better. So you’re saying $1,000 a month for everyone over 18, but a value added tax. So you can spend that $1,000 on value added tax?",June
Andrew Yang,"Well, the value added tax would end up … you’d still be increasing the buying power of the bottom 94% of Americans. You have to spend a lot of money for a mild value add tax to eat up $12,000 a year per individual. So for the average family with two or three adults, it’d be $24,000 to $36,000 a year.",June
Jose,"Okay. Congressman Swalwell, I want to talk a little bit about what Mr. Yang is talking about it, and you just actually mentioned. That many Americans are worried that things like self driving cars, robots, drones, artificial intelligence will cost them their jobs. What would you do to help people get the skills they need to adapt to this new world?",June
Eric Swalwell,"We must always be a country where technology creates more jobs than it displaces. And I’ve seen the anxiety across America, where the manufacturing floors go from a thousand to a hundred to one.",June
Eric Swalwell,"So we have to modernize our schools, value the teachers who prepare our kids, wipe the student debt from any teacher that goes into a community that needs it. Invest in America’s communities, especially where places where the best exports are people who move away to get skills.",June
Eric Swalwell,"But Jose, I was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said, “It’s time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans.” That candidate was then Senator Joe Biden.",June
Eric Swalwell,"Joe Biden was right when he said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans 32 years ago. He’s still right today. If we’re going to solve the issues of automation, pass the torch. If we’re going to solve the issues of climate chaos, pass the torch. If we’re going to solve the issue of student loan debt, pass the torch. If we’re going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school, pass the torch.",June
Jose,"Vice President, would you like to sing a torch song?",June
Joe Biden,"I would. I’m still holding on that torch. I want to make it clear to you. Look, the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on for an education.",June
Joe Biden,"The fact is that, that’s why I propose us focusing on schools that are in distress. That’s why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title 1 schools. That’s why I think we should have universal pre-k. That’s why I think every single person who graduates from high school, 65 out of a 100 now need something beyond high school, and we should provide for them to be able to get that education. That’s why there should be free community college, cutting it in half the cost of college. That’s why we should be in a position where we do not have anyone have to pay back a student debt when they get out if they are making less than $25,000 a year. Their debt is frozen, no interest payment until they get beyond that.",June
Joe Biden,"We can’t put people in a position where they aren’t able to go on and move on. So folks, there’s a lot we can do, but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st century. We’re not doing that now.",June

Kamala Harris,"Hey guys, you know what? America does not want to witness a food fight, they want to know how we’re going to put food on their table. On that point, part of the issue that is at play in America today, and we’ve all been traveling around the country, I certainly have. I’m meeting people who are working two and three jobs. You know, this President walks around talking about and flouting his great economy, right? My great economy, my great economy. You ask him, “Well, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours?” And he talks about the stock market.",June
Kamala Harris,"Well, that’s fine if you own stocks. So many families in America do not. You ask him, “How are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours?” And they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. Well, yeah, people in America are working. They’re working two and three jobs. So when we talk about jobs, let’s be really clear, in our America, no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table.",June
Jose,"Thank you very much, Senator.",June
Jose,You’ve all expressed an interest in talking about health care-,June
Speaker 7,"I’d like to say something, if I might.",June
Jose,… so let’s talk about healthcare. And this is going to be a show of hands question. We asked a question …,June
Lester Holt,"Let’s talk about healthcare. This is going to be a show of hands question. We asked a question about healthcare last night that spurred a lot of discussion, as you know. We’re going to do it again now. Many people watching at home have healthcare through their employer. Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government run plan?",June
Lester Holt,"All right. Kirsten , Senator Gildebrand.",June
Kirsten G.,"Yeah, so no it’s my turn.",June
Speaker 8,Go ahead.,June
Kirsten G.,"This is a very important issue. The plan that Senator Sanders and I other support Medicare for All, is how you get to single payer. But it has a buy-in transition period, which is really important. In 2005, when I ran for Congress in a two to one republican district, I actually ran on Medicare for All, and I won that two to one republican district. Twice.",June
Kirsten G.,"The way I formulated it was simple. Anyone who doesn’t have access to insurance they like, they could buy in at a percentage of income they could afford. That’s what we put into the transition period for our Medicare for All plan. I believe we need to get to universal healthcare as a right and not a privilege to single pair. The quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers.",June
Kirsten G.,"God bless the insurers if they want to compete. They can certainly try. But they’ve never put people over their profits, and I doubt they ever will. What will happen is people will choose Medicare, you will transition. We will get to Medicare for All, and then your step to single player is so short I would make it an earned benefit, just like Social Security, so that buy in your whole life-",June
Lester Holt,All right.,June
Kirsten G.,"It is always there for you, and it’s permanent and it’s universal.",June
Lester Holt,"Senator, your time is up. I’m going to put that same question to Mayor Buttigieg.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"Yo, we’ve taught… Look, everybody who says Medicare for All, every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how you’re actually supposed to get from here to there.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"And here’s how I would do it. It’s very similar. I would call it Medicare for All Who Want It. You take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, and you make it available on the exchanges. People can buy in, and then people like us are right that that will not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single payer environment.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"But let’s remember, even in countries that have outright socialized medicine like England, even there, there’s still a private sector. That’s fine, it’s just that for our primary care we can’t be relying on the tender mercies of the corporate system. This is one is very personal for me. I started out this year dealing with the terminal illness of my father. I make decisions for a living.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"Nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced. But the thing we had going for us was that we never had to make those decisions based on whether it was going to bankrupt our family, because of Medicare.",June
Lester Holt,"All right, man.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"I want every family to have that same freedom to do what is medically right, not live in .",June
Lester Holt,"Thank you. Your time is complete. Vice President Biden, I want to put the question to you. You were one of the architects of Obamacare, so where do we go from here?",June
Joe Biden,"Look, this is very personal to me. When my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, my two boys were really very badly injured. I couldn’t imagine what it’d be like had I not had adequate healthcare available immediately. Then when my son came home from Iraq after a year and was diagnosed with terminal cancer, he was given months to live.",June
Joe Biden,"I can’t fathom what would have happened if in fact they said, “By the way, the last six months of your life, you’re on your own. We’re cutting off. You’ve used up your time.” The fact of the matter is, that the quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obamacare. To build on what we did. Secondly, to make sure that everyone does have any option.",June
Joe Biden,"Everyone, whether they have private insurance, employer insurance, or no insurance, they in fact could buy in in the exchange to a Medicare-like plan. The way to do that, you can do it quickly. Look, urgency matters. There’s people right now facing what I faced, and what we faced, without any of the help I had. We must move now. I am against any democrat who opposes and tries to take down Obamacare-",June
Lester Holt,"All right, Vice President Biden, you’re time is-",June
Joe Biden,And any republican who wants to get rid of Obamacare .,June
Lester Holt,"California, Vermont, New York has struggled with it, have been successful. If politicians can’t make it work in those states, how would you implement it on a national level? How does this work?",June
Bernie Sanders,"Listen, I find it hard to believe that other major country on earth, including my neighbor 50 miles north me- Canada, somehow has figured out a way to provide healthcare to every man, woman and child, and in most cases, they’re spending 50% per capita what we are spending. Let’s be clear. Let us be very clear.",June
Bernie Sanders,"The function of healthcare today from the insurance and drug company perspective, is not to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way. The function of the healthcare system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies. Last year, if you could believe it, while we paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs- and I will lower the prescription drug prices in half in this country- Top 10 companies made $69 billion dollars in profit.",June
Bernie Sanders,"They will spend hundreds of millions of dollars lying to the American people, telling us why we cannot have a Medicare for All -",June
Lester Holt,"Senator, Senator… I just to have follow up there. How do implement it on a national level?",June
Bernie Sanders,I’m sorry?,June
Lester Holt,"How do you implement it on a national level, given the fact it’s not succeeded in other states that have tried?",June
Bernie Sanders,"I will tell you how we’ll do it. We’ll do it way real change has always taken place, whether it was the Labor Movement, the Civil Rights Movement, or the Women’s Movement. We will have Medicare for All. When tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone, that healthcare is a human right, not something to make huge profits off of.",June
Lester Holt,"Okay, all right. Ms. Williamson . Ms. Williamson, this is the question for you. We have been … Excuse me, excuse. I’m addressing the question to Ms. Williams. We’ve been talking a lot about access to health insurance, but for many Americans, their most pressing concern is the high cost of healthcare. How would you lower the cost of prescription drugs?",June
Williamson,"Well, first of all, the government should never had made the deal with the big pharma that they couldn’t negotiate. That was just part of the regular corruption by which multinational corporations have their way with us. You know, I wanted to say that while I’m with Senator Bennet and others, but I agree with almost everything here- I’ll tell you one thing, it’s really nice that we’ve got all these plans, but if you think we’re going to beat Donald Trump by just having all these plans, you got another thing coming. Because he didn’t win by saying he had a plan. He won by simply saying, “Make America Great Again.”",June
Williamson,"We’ve got to get deeper than just these superficial fixes, as important as they are. Even if we’re just talking about the superficial fixes, ladies and gentlemen, we don’t have a healthcare system in the United States. We have a sickness care system in the United States. We just wait until somebody gets sick, and then we talk about who’s going to pay for the treatment and how they’re going to be treated.",June
Williamson,"What we need to talk about is why so many Americans have unnecessary chronic illnesses, so many more compared to other countries. That gets back into not just the big pharma, not just health insurance companies, it has to do with chemical policies, it has to do with environmental-",June
Lester Holt,All right.,June
Williamson,Policies.,June
Lester Holt,"Ms. Williams, your time has expired.",June
Williamson,It has to do with food policies. It has to do with drug policies-,June
Lester Holt,Thank you.,June
Williamson,It even has to do with the environmental policies.,June
Lester Holt,"Senator Bennet, a question for you. You want to keep the system that we have in place with Obamacare and build out. You mentioned that a moment ago. Is that enough to get us to universal coverage?",June
Bennett,"I believe that will get us the quickest way there, and I thought the Vice President was very moving about this and Mayor Pete as well. I had prostate cancer recently, as you may know, and why I was a little race getting in the race. The same week, my kid had her appendectomy out, and I feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice.",June
Bennett,"I think that’s what the American people want. I believe it will get us there quickly. There are millions of people in America that do not have health insurance today because they can’t. They’re too “wealthy”. They make too much money to be on Medicaid. They can’t afford health insurance. When Senator Sanders says that Canada is single pair, there are 35 million people in Canada. There are 330 million people in the United States. Easily the number of people on a public option.",June
Bennett,"It could easily be 35 million, and for them, it would be Medicare for All, as Mayor Buttigieg says. But for others that want to keep it, they should be able to keep it. I think that will be the fastest way to get where we need to go. Also-",June
Kamala Harris,I’d like to add a point-,June
Bennett,"I will say, Bernie is a very honest person. He has said over and over again- unlike others that have supported this legislation- over and over again, that this will ban, make illegal, all insurance except cosmetic, except insurance for… I guess that’s for plastic surgery. Everything else is banned under the Medicare for All proposal, but he is he -",June
Lester Holt,"I’d let you go a little there, but-",June
Kamala Harris,I’d like to add a point.,June
Lester Holt,"Obviously, Senator Sanders, you get a response.",June
Kamala Harris,I would like to add a point here.,June
Lester Holt,"Senator Sanders, he’s going to respond to that.",June
Bernie Sanders,"Just very briefly. You know Mike, Medicare is the most popular health insurance-",June
Bennett,I agree.,June
Bernie Sanders,"Program in the country. People don’t like their private insurance companies. They like their doctors and hospitals. Under our plan, people go to any doctor they want, any hospital they want. We will substantially lower the cost of healthcare in the country because we’ll stop the greed of the insurance company .",June
Lester Holt,One at a time. . Senator Harris. .,June
Kamala Harris,"-And the reality of how this affects real people is captured in a story that many of us heard, and I will paraphrase. There is- any night in America- a parent who’s seeing that their child has a temperature that is out of control, calls 9-1-1, “What should I do?” They say, “Take the child to the emergency room.”",June
Kamala Harris,"So they get in their car and they drive, and they’re sitting in the parking lot outside of the emergency room looking at those sliding glass doors, while they have the hand on the forehead of their child knowing that if they walk through those sliding glass doors- even though they have insurance- they will be out of $5,000.00 deductible. $ 5,000.00 deductible when they walk through those doors.",June
Lester Holt,All right. Senator Harris-,June

Savannah G.,"Congressman, thank you.",June
Eric Swalwell,We fight health insurance companies every single week.,June
Savannah G.,Thank you.,June
Eric Swalwell,"We stand in line and pay expensive prescription drugs. We have to have a healthcare guarantee. If you’re sick, you’re seen. And in America, you never go broke because of it.",June
Savannah G.,Okay. A lot of you have been  talking tonight about these government healthcare plans that you’ve proposed in one form or another. This is a show of hands question- and hold them up for a moment so people can see- raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.,June
Savannah G.,"Okay. Let me start with you, Mayor Buttigieg. Why? Mayor Buttigieg, why?",June
Pete Buttigieg,"Because our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. Remember, we’re talking about something people are given a chance to buy into. In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community, who pay. They pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly. This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"And we do ourselves no favors by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access healthcare. But of course the real problem is, we should have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship. It makes no sense. The American people agree on what to do. This is the crazy thing, if leadership consists of forming a consensus around a device of issue… This White House has divided us around a consensus issue.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"The American people want a pathway to citizenship, they wanted protections for Dreamers, we need to clean up the lawful immigration system- like how my father immigrated to this country, and as part of a comprise, we can do whatever common sense measures are needed at the border-",June
Savannah G.,Mayor-,June
Pete Buttigieg,But Washington can’t deliver on something the American people want. What does that tell you about the system we’re living in? It tells you-,June
Savannah G.,"Mayor, thank you.",June
Pete Buttigieg,It needs profound structural reform.,June
Savannah G.,"Vice President Biden, I believe you said that your healthcare plan would not cover undocumented immigrants. Could you explain your position?",June
Joe Biden,"I’m sorry, beg your pardon? I didn’t hear.",June
Savannah G.,"I believe at the show of hands, you did not raise your hand. Did you raise your hand?",June
Joe Biden,"Oh, no I did.",June
Savannah G.,"Okay, sorry. Sorry, so you said that they would be covered under your plan-",June
Joe Biden,Yeah.,June
Savannah G.,Which is different than Obamacare.,June
Joe Biden,"Yes, but here’s the thing-",June
Savannah G.,Can you explain that change?,June
Joe Biden,"Yes, you cannot let, as the Mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick- no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You can’t do that. It’s just going to be taken care of period. You have to. It’s the humane thing to do.",June
Joe Biden,"But here’s the deal, the deal is that he’s right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the wellbeing of the country, but they also, for example, they’ve increased the life span of Social Security because if they have a job, they’re paying the Social Security tax. That’s what they’re doing. It’s increasing the life span.",June
Joe Biden,"They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of healthcare by them being able to be treated and not wait until they’re an extremist. The other thing is, folks, look we can deal with these insurance companies. We can deal with the insurance companies by number one, putting insurance executives in jail for their misleading advertising which they’re doing on opioids, what they’re doing paying doctors to prescribe.",June
Joe Biden,"We could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on Medicare, that the government should be able to negotiate the price for whatever the drug costs are. We can do this by making sure that we’re in a position that we in fact allow people-",June
Lester Holt,"Your time’s up.  Hold off for a minute, we need to take a short break here. We’ve got a lot more we need to talk to all of you about, so stick with us. We’re just getting started. We’ll be back with more from Miami right after this.",June
Lester Holt,Welcome back from Miami. Jose is going to lead off the questioning in this round.,June
Jose,"Thank you very much. Senator Harris, last month more than 130, 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border. Many of them are being detained, including small children in private detention centers in Florida and throughout our country. Most of the candidates on this stage say the conditions of these facilities are abhorrent.",June
Jose,"On January 20, 2021, if you are President, what specifically would you do with the thousands of people who try to reach the United States every day and want a better life through asylum?",June
Kamala Harris,"Immediately, on January 20, 2021, I will first off… We cannot forget our DACA recipients, so I’m going to start there. I will immediately, by executive action, reinstate DACA status and DACA protection to those young people. I will further extend protection for deferral of deportation for their parents, and for veterans- who we have so many who are undocumented and have served our country and fought for our democracy.",June
Kamala Harris,"I will also immediately put in place a meaningful process for reviewing the cases for asylum. I will release children from cages. I will get rid of the private detention centers. And I will ensure that with this microphone that the President of the United States holds in her hand, is used in a way that is about reflecting the values of our country, and not about locking children up, separating them from-",June
Kamala Harris,"And not about locking children up, separating them from their parents. And I have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people. A mother, who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin, through the entire country of Mexico, facing unknown peril, to come here. Why would that mother do that? I will tell you. Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse. But what does Donald Trump do? He says, “Go back to where you came from.” That is not reflective of our America, and our values, and it’s got to end.",June
Jose,"Governor Hickenlooper. Governor Hickenlooper, day one at the White House, how do you respond?",June

If you’d ever told me any time in my life that this country would sanction federal agents to take children from the arms of their parents, put them in cages, actually put them up for adoption… In colorado, we call that kidnapping. I would’ve told you it was unbelievable.",June
John H.,"And the first thing we have to do is recognize the humanitarian crisis on the border for what it is. We make sure that there are sufficient facilities in place so that women and children are not separated from their families, that children are with their families. We have to make sure that ICE is completely reformed, and they begin looking at their job in a humanitarian way, where they’re addressing the whole needs of the people that they are engaged with along the border.",June
John H.,"And we have to make sure ultimately, that we provide not just shelter, but food, clothing, and access to medical care.",June
Jose,Ms. Williamson.,June
Williamson,"Yes, what Donald Trump has done to these children, and it’s not just in Colorado, Governor, you’re right, it is kidnapping. And it’s extremely important for us to realize that. If you forcibly take a child from their parent’s arms, you’re kidnapping them. And if you take a lot of children, and you put them in a detainment center, thus inflicting chronic trauma upon them, that’s called child abuse. This is called collective child abuse. And when this is crime, both of those things are a crime, and if your government does it, that doesn’t make it less of a crime. These are state sponsored crimes.",June
Williamson,"And what President Trump has done, is not only attack these children, not only demonize these immigrants, he is attacking a basic principle of America’s moral core. We open our hearts to the stranger. This is extremely important. And it’s also important for all of us, remember. And I have great respect for everyone who is on this stage, but we’re going to talk about what to do about healthcare? Well, where have you been guys, because it’s not just a matter of a plan. And I haven’t heard anybody on this stage who has talked about American Foreign policy in Latin America, and how we might have in the last few decades, contributed to something being more helpful.",June
Jose,"Senator Gillibrand, what would you do as President, with a reality?",June
Kirsten G.,"Well, one of the worst things about President Trump that he’s done to this country, is he has torn apart the moral fabric of who we are. When he started separating children at the border, from their parents, the fact that seven children have died at his custody, the fact that dozens of children have been separated from their parents, and they have no plan to reunite them. So I would do a few things. First I would fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. Second, I would reform how we treat asylum seekers at the border. I would have a community based treatment center where you’re doing it within the communities, where asylum seekers are given lawyers, where there’s real immigration judges, not employees of the attorney general, but appointed for life, and have a community based system.",June
Kirsten G.,"I would fund border security. But the worst thing President Trump has done is he’s diverted the funds away from cross border terrorism, cross border human trafficking, drug trafficking, and gun trafficking, and he’s given that money to the for-profit prisons. I would not be spending money in for-profit prisons to lock up children and asylum seekers.",June
Jose,"We had a very spirited debate on this stage last night on the topic of decriminalization of the border. If you’d be so kind, raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense, rather than a crime to cross the border without documentation. Can we keep the hands up so we can see them.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"Let’s remember that’s not just a theoretical exercise. That criminalization, that is the basis for family separation. You do away with that, it’s no longer possible. Of course, it wouldn’t be possible anyway in my presidency, because it is dead wrong.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"We’ve got to talk about one other thing, because the Republican party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion. Now, our party doesn’t talk about that as much, largely for a very good reason, which was we are committed to the separation of church and state, and we stand for people of any religion, and people of no religion.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it. And for a party that associates itself with Christianity, to say that it is okay to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages, has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.",June
Jose,"Mr. Vice President, I don’t know if you raised your hand, or were just asking to speak. Would you decriminalize crossing the border without documents?",June
Joe Biden,"The first thing I would do, is unite families. I’d surge immediately, billions of dollars worth of help to the region, immediately.",June
Joe Biden,"Look, I talk about foreign policy. I’m the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign, at the very end of our term, to spend 740 million dollars to deal with the problem. And that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place. It was working. We saw, as you know, a net decrease in the number of children who were coming. The crisis was abated. And along came this president, and he said he’d immediately discontinue that.",June
Joe Biden,"We all talk about these things. I did it. I did it. 740 million… Now look, second thing we have to do. The law now requires that reuniting those families. We would reunite those families, period. And if not, we’d put those children in a circumstance where they were safe, until we could find their parents.",June
Joe Biden,"And lastly, the idea that he’s in court with his justice department, saying children in cages do not need a bed, do not need a blanket, do not need a toothbrush, that is outrageous, and it should stop.",June
Jose,"Vice President, the Obama Biden administration deported more than three million Americans. My question to you is if an individual is living in the United States of America without documents, and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?",June
Williamson,No.,June
Joe Biden,"Depending if they committed a major crime, they should be deported. President Obama, I think, did a heck of a job. To compare him to what this guy is doing is absolutely, I find, close to immoral.",June
Joe Biden,"But the fact is, that look, we should not be locking people up. We should be making sure we change the circumstance, as we did, why they would leave in the first place. And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe, until they can be heard.",June
Jose,"Fifteen second, if you wish to answer. Should someone who is here without documents, and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?",June
Joe Biden,That person should not be the focus of deportation. We should fundamentally change the way we deal with things.,June
Jose,Senator.,June
Williamson,I think it’s important…,June
Bernie Sanders,"I want to suggest that I agree with a lot of what Kamala just said. And that is on day one, we take out our executive order pen, and we rescind every damn thing on this issue, that Trump has done.",June
Bernie Sanders,"Number two, picking up on the point that Joe made. We got to look at the root causes. And you have a situation where Honduras, among other things, is a failing state, massive corruption. You’ve got gangs who are telling families, that if a ten year old does not join that gang, that family is going to be killed.",June
Bernie Sanders,What we have got to do on day one is invite the Presidents and the leadership of Central America and Mexico together. This is a hemisphere problem that we have got to address.,June
Jose,Thank you. Congressman Swalwell. What do you do?,June
Eric Swalwell,Day one?,June
Jose,"No. If someone is here without documents, and that is their only offense, is that person to be deported.",June
Eric Swalwell,"No. That person can be a part of this great American experience. That person can contribute. My congressional district is one of the most diverse in America, and we see the benefits when people contribute, and they become a part of the community, and they’re not in the shadow economy.",June
Eric Swalwell,"Day one for me, families are reunited. This President, though, for immigrants, there’s nothing he will not do to separate a family, cage a child, or erase their existence by weaponizing the census. And there is nothing that we cannot do in the courts, and that I will not do as president to reverse that, and to make sure that families always belong together.",June
Jose,Senator Harris.,June
Kamala Harris,"Well, thank you. I will say no, absolutely not. They should not be deported. And I actually… This was one of the very few issues with which I disagreed with the administration, with whom I otherwise had great relationship, and a great deal of respect. But on the secure communities issue, I was Attorney General of California. I led the second largest Department of Justice in The United States, second only to The United States Department of Justice in a state of 40 million people. And on this issue, I disagreed with my President, because the policy was to allow deportation of people, who by ICE’s own definition were non-criminals.",June
Kamala Harris,"So as attorney general, and the Chief Law Officer of the state of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state, that they did not have to comply with detainers, and instead, should make decisions based on the best interest of public safely of their community. Because what I saw, and I was tracking it every day, I was tracking it and saw that parents, people who had not committed a crime, even by ICE’s own definition, were being deported.",June
Kamala Harris,"But I have to add a point here. The problem with this kind of policy, and I know it as a prosecutor. I want rape victim to be able to run in the middle of the street and wave down a police officer and report the crime against her. I want anybody who has been the victim of any real crime to be able to do that, and not be afraid that if they do that, they will be deported, because the abuser will tell them it is they who is the criminal. It is wrong. It is wrong.",June
Lester Holt,"Senator. We’re going to turn to the issue of trade now, if we can. Last night, we asked the candidates on this stage, to name the greatest geopolitical threat facing the US. Four of them mentioned China. US businesses say China steals our intellectual property, and party leaders on both sides accuse China of manipulating their currency to keep the cost of goods artificially low.",June
Lester Holt,"I’ll ask this to Senator Bennet, to start off with. How would you stand up to China.",June
Bennett,"I think that first of all, the biggest threat to our national security right now is Russia, not China. And second, on China, we’ve got competition… Because of what they’ve done with our election. In China, I think the President’s been right to push back on China, but has done it in completely the wrong way.",June
Bennett,"We should mobilize the entire rest of the world, who all have a shared interest in pushing back on China’s mercantilist trade policies, and I think we can do that.",June
Bennett,"I’d like to answer the other question before this, as well.",June
Lester Holt,You have the time.,June
Bennett,"When I see these kids at the border, I see my mom, because I know she sees herself, because she was separated from her parents for years during the Holocaust in Poland.",June
Bennett,"And for Donald Trump to be doing what he’s doing to children and their families at the borders… I say this as somebody who wrote the immigration bill in 2013, that created a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country, that had the most progressive Dream Act that’s every been conceived, much less passed. It got 68 votes in the Senate. That had 46 billion dollars of border security in it. That was sophisticated 21st Century border security, not a medieval wall.",June
Lester Holt,"Senator, your time.",June
Bennett,"And the President has turned the border of the United States into a symbol of nativist hostility, that the whole world is looking at, when what we should be represented by, is the Statue of Liberty, which has brought my parents to this country to begin with. We need to make a change.",June
Lester Holt,"Mr. Yang, let me bring you in on this, on the issue of China. You have expressed a lot of concerns about technology, and taking jobs. Are you worried about China, and if so, how would you stand up against it.",June
Andrew Yang,"Well, I just want to agree that I think Russia is our greatest geopolitical threat, because they’ve been hacking our democracy successfully, and they’ve been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years. So we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats.",June
Andrew Yang,"Now, China, they do pirate our intellectual property. It’s a massive problem. But the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides. I met with a farmer in Iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in China that’s now disappeared and gone forever. And the beneficiaries have not been American workers or people in China. It’s been Southeast Asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void.",June
Andrew Yang,"So we need to crack down on Chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship, but the tariffs and the trade war are the way to go.",June
Lester Holt,"Mayor Buttigieg, how would you stand up against China?",June
Pete Buttigieg,"First of all, we’ve got to recognize that the China challenge really is a serious one. This is not something to dismiss or wave away. And if you look at what China is doing, they’re using technology for the perfection of dictatorship. But their fundamental economic model isn’t going to change because of some tariffs.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"I live in the industrial Midwest. Folks who aren’t in the shadow of a factory, or somewhere near a soy field where I live. And manufacturers, and especially soy farmers, are hurting. Tariffs are taxes, and Americans are going to pay on average 800 dollars more a year, because of these tariffs.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"Meanwhile, China is investing, so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence. And this President is fixated on the kind of relationship as if all that mattered was the export balance on dishwashers. We’ve got a much bigger issue on our hands.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"But in a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours, because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now, because of our internal divisions, the biggest thing we’ve got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness.",June
Lester Holt,"All right Mayor, thank you.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"If we disinvest in our own infrastructure, education, we are never going to be able to compete. And if we really want to be an alternative, a democratic alternative, we actually have to demonstrate that we care about democratic values at home and around the world.",June
Lester Holt,Thank you for your input.,June
Savannah G.,"We’ve got a good debate so far. We’re going to take a quick break here, candidates. When we come back, the questioning continues with our colleagues. Chuck Todd, Rachel Maddow will be here. Much more with our candidates, straight ahead.",June
Chuck Todd,"For this first debate. We’ve heard from 10 of them from last night. We’re hearing from 10 more tonight. Breakdown for each night was selected at random. Candidates will have 60 seconds to answer direct questions, 30 seconds for followups if necessary.",June
Rachel Maddow,Because of this large field of candidates not every person will be able to comment on everything but the less audience reaction there is the more time they will all get.,June
Rachel Maddow,"Over the course of the next hour we will hear from all of these candidates but we are going to begin this hour with Mayor Buttigieg. In the last five years, civil rights activists in our country have led a national debate over race and the criminal justice system.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Your community of South Bend, Indiana has recently been in uproar over an officer-involved shooting. The police force in South Bend is now 6% black in a city that is 26% black. Why has that not improved over your two terms as mayor?",June
Pete Buttigieg,Because I couldn’t get it done. My community is in anguish right now because of an officer-involved shooting. A black man Eric Logan killed by a white officer. I’m not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back. The officer says he was attacked with a knife but he didn’t have his body camera on. It’s a mess. We’re hurting.,June
Pete Buttigieg,"I could walk you through all of the things we have done as a community, all of the steps that we took from bias training to deescalation but it didn’t save the life of Eric Logan. When I look into his mother’s eyes I have to face the fact that nothing that I say will bring him back.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"This is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country. Until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism, whatever this particular incident teaches us, we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there’s a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time. Not just from what’s happened in the past but from what’s happening around the country in the present.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"It threatens the wellbeing of every community. I am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle, when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing. A feeling not of fear but of safety.",June
Rachel Maddow,That’s time.,June
Pete Buttigieg,I am determined to bring that day about.,June
Rachel Maddow,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor.",June
John H.,Mayor Buttigieg. . If I could ask one question just because I think …,June
Rachel Maddow,"Governor, I’ll give you 30 seconds.",June
John H.,"I think that the question they’re asking in South Bend, I think it’s seen across the country as why has it taken so long? We had a shooting when I first became mayor 10 years before Ferguson and the community came together and we created an office of the independent moderates, a civilian oversight commission. We diversified the police force in two years. We actually did deescalation training.",June
John H.,I think the real question that America should be asking is why five years after Ferguson every city doesn’t have this level of police accountability?,June
Rachel Maddow,"Governor Hickenlooper, thank you.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"I’ve got to respond to that. Look, we’ve taken so many steps towards police accountability. The FOP just denounced me for too much accountability. We’re obviously not there yet. I accept responsibility for that because I am in charge.",June
John H.,camera wasn’t on and that was a policy and you should fire the chief.,June
Pete Buttigieg,"Under Indiana law, this will be investigated and there will be accountability for the officer involved.",June
John H.,But you’re the mayor. You should fire the chief. If that’s the policy and someone died.,June
Marianne W.,"All of these issues are extremely important but there are specifics. There are symptoms. The underlying cause has to do with deep, deep, deep realms of racial injustice both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system.",June
Marianne W.,The Democratic party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason. I do not believe that the average American is a racist but the average American is woefully undereducated about the history of race in the United States.,June
Rachel Maddow,"Ms. Williamson, thank you very much .",June
Chuck Todd,"Vice President Biden, we’re going to get to you. Hang on. We’re going to get .",June
Kamala Harris,stage I would like to speak on the issue of race.,June
Rachel Maddow,Senator Harris .,June
Kamala Harris,What I will say is that I .,June
Rachel Maddow,"Preface this, we will give you 30 seconds. We’re going to come back to you on this again in just a moment. Go for 30 seconds.",June
Kamala Harris,"Okay. On the issue of race I couldn’t agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly. There is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend, or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination.",June
Kamala Harris,Growing up my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents said couldn’t play with us because we were black.,June
Kamala Harris,I will say also that in this campaign we’ve also heard … I’m going to now direct this at Vice President Biden. I do not believe you are a racist. I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.,June
Kamala Harris,I also believe … It’s personal. It was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.,June
Kamala Harris,It was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing. There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools. She was bused to school every day. That little girl was me.,June
Kamala Harris,"I will tell you that on this subject it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly. As Attorney General of California, I was very proud to put in place a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Harris, thank you. Vice President Biden, you have been invoked. We are going to  chance to respond. Vice President Biden.",June
Joe Biden,"It’s a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I do not praise racists. That is not true. Number one. Number two, if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not I’m happy to do that.",June
Joe Biden,"I was a public defender. I didn’t become a prosecutor. I came out and I left a good law firm to become a public defender when, in fact, my city was in flames because of the assassination of Dr. King. Number one.",June
Joe Biden,"Now number two as the Vice President of the United States I work with a man who, in fact, we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major, major way.",June
Joe Biden,The fact is in terms of busing the busing I never … You would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council. That’s fine. That’s one of the things I argued for that we should be breaking down these lines.,June
Joe Biden,"The bottom line here is, look, everything I’ve done in my career … I ran because of civil rights. I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights. Those civil rights, by the way, include not just only African-Americans but the LGBT community.",June
Kamala Harris,"Vice President Biden, do you agree today, do you agree today, that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then?",June
Joe Biden,No.,June
Kamala Harris,Do you agree?,June
Joe Biden,I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education. That’s what I opposed. I did not oppose …,June
Kamala Harris,"Well, there was a failure of states to integrate public schools in America. I was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley, California public schools almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education.",June
Joe Biden,Because your city council made that decision. It was a local decision.,June
Kamala Harris,That’s where the federal government must step in.,June
Joe Biden,.,June
Kamala Harris,That’s why we have the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act. That’s why we need to pass the Equality Act. That’s why we need to pass the ERA because there are moments in history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.,June
Joe Biden,I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran .,June
Chuck Todd,"Okay. Vice President Biden, 30 seconds because I want to bring other people into this.",June
Joe Biden,"I supported the ERA from the very beginning. I’m the guy that extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. We got to the place where we got 98 of the 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it. I’ve also argued very strongly that we, in fact, deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box. I agree that everybody wants … Anyway, my time is up. I’m sorry.",June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you, Vice President.",June
Marianne W.,All of these things have to do .,June
Chuck Todd,"Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, I’m going to go to you on this. You said on the day you launched your campaign that voters should focus on what people stand for, not a candidate’s race or age or sexual orientation. Many Democrats are very excited by the diversity of this field, on this stage, and on last night’s stage, and the perspective that diversity brings to this contest and to these issues. Are you telling Democratic voters that diversity shouldn’t matter when they make this decision?",June
Bernie Sanders,"No. Absolutely not. Unlike the Republican party, we encourage diversity, we believe in diversity. That’s what America is about. In addition to diversity in terms of having more women, more people from the LGBT community, we also have to do something else.",June
Bernie Sanders,That is we have to ask ourselves a simple question. How come today the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1% has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth.,June
Bernie Sanders,We need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interests who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.,June
Chuck Todd,"Senator Gillibrand, I want to give you 30 seconds on this.",June
Kirsten G.,"Well, first of all, where Bernie left off we’ve heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans. The truth is until you go to the root of the corruption the money in politics, the fact that Washington is run by the special interests, you are never going to solve any of these problems.",June
Kirsten G.,"I have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption, to get money out of politics, through publicly- funded elections, to have clean elections.",June
Kirsten G.,"If we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right, not a privilege. We can deal with institutional racism, we can take on income inequality, and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs Washington.",June
Joe Biden,The first Constitutional amendment to do that was introduced by me when I was a young senator.,June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you, Vice President. We want to shift topics here. Senator Bennet, the next question is for you. On the issue of partisan gridlock, President Obama promised in 2012 that after his reelection Republicans would want to work with Democrats. The fever would break. That did not happen.",June
Chuck Todd,"Now Vice President Biden is saying the same thing, that if he is elected in 2020 both parties will want to work together. Should voters believe that somehow if there’s a Democratic president in 2021 that gridlock is going to magically disappear?",June
Michael Bennet,"Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first. Second, that’s why it is so important for us to win not just the presidency, to have somebody that can run in all 50 states, but to win the Senate as well.",June
Michael Bennet,"That’s why we have to propose policies that can be supported like Medicare so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington, DC. I agree with what Senator Gillibrand was saying. I share a lot of her views.",June
Michael Bennet,We need to end gerrymandering. We need to end political gerrymandering in Washington. The court today said they couldn’t do anything about it. We need to overturn Citizens United. The court was the one that gave us Citizens United and the attack on voting rights in Shelby vs Holder is something we need to deal with.,June
Michael Bennet,"All of those things has happened since Vice President Biden was in the Senate. We face structural problems that we have to overcome with a broad coalition. It’s the only way we can do it. We need to root out the corruption in Washington, expand people’s right to get to the polls, and I think then we can succeed.",June
Chuck Todd,"Vice President Biden, 30 seconds. It does sound as if you haven’t seen what’s been happening in the United States Senate over the last 12 years. It didn’t happen. Why?",June
Joe Biden,I have seen what happened. Just since we were Vice President. We needed three votes to pass an $800 recovery act that kept us from going into a depression. I got three votes changed. We needed to be able to keep the government from shutting down and going bankrupt. I got Mitch McConnell to raise taxes $600 billion by raising the top rate.,June
Joe Biden,As recently as after President got elected I was able to put together a coalition of  that billions of dollars go into cancer research bipartisan.,June
Joe Biden,"Sometimes you can’t do that. Sometimes you just have to go out and beat them. I went into 20 states, over 60 candidates, and guess what? We beat them. We won back the Senate.",June
Chuck Todd,Thank you.,June
Michael Bennet,"Chuck, the problem with what the Vice President …",June
Chuck Todd,30 seconds.,June
Michael Bennet,No. The problem …,June
Chuck Todd,30 seconds. Go ahead.,June
Michael Bennet,Sometimes you do have to beat them but the deal that he talked about with Mitch McConnell was a complete victory for the Tea Party. It extended the Bush tax cuts permanently. The Democratic party had been running against that for 10 years. We lost that economic argument because that deal extended almost all those Bush tax cuts permanently and put in place the mindless cuts that we still are dealing with today that are called the sequester. That was a great deal for Mitch McConnell. It was a terrible deal for America.,June
Kirsten G.,.,June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you, Senator Bennet.",June
Kirsten G.,.,June
Chuck Todd,Go ahead. 30 seconds.,June
Kirsten G.,You heard from the Republicans that the reason why the Trump tax cut had to be passed is because they had to pay back their donors. You heard it. They actually said those words.,June
Kirsten G.,"The corruption in Washington is real. It is something that makes every one of the plans we’ve heard about over the last several months impossible. I have the most comprehensive approach to do it with clean elections, publicly-funded elections.",June
Kirsten G.,We restore the power of our democracy into the hands of the voters. Not into the Koch brothers. We were talking about issues. We’re in Florida. Imagine the Parkland kids having as much power in our democracy as the Koch brothers or the NRA. Imagine their voices carrying farther and wider than anyone else because their voice is needed. .,June
Chuck Todd,"Senator Gillibrand, I’m trying to get everybody in here.",June
Kirsten G.,"As President, it’s the first thing I’m going to do because nothing else is possible, whether it’s education or healthcare or ending institutional racism.",June
Chuck Todd,Thank you very much.,June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Sanders, I’d like to put a different question to you. Roe vs Wade has been the law of the land since 1973. Now that there is a conservative majority on the Supreme Court several Republican controlled states have passed laws to severely restrict or even ban abortion.",June
Rachel Maddow,One of those laws could very well make it to the Supreme Court during your presidency if you are elected president. What is your plan if Roe is struck down in the court while you’re president?,June
Bernie Sanders,"Well, my plan as somebody who believes for a start that a woman’s right to control her own body is a constitutional right that government and politicians should not infringe on that right. We will do everything we can to defend Roe vs Wade.",June
Bernie Sanders,"Second of all, let me make a promise here. You ask about a litmus test. My litmus test is I will never appoint, nominate, any justice to the Supreme Court unless that justice is 100% clear he or she will defend Roe v. Wade.",June
Bernie Sanders,"Third of all, I do not believe in packing the court. We got a terrible 5-4 majority conservative court right now. I do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts. That brings new blood into the Supreme Court and a majority I hope that will understand that a woman has the right to control her own body and that corporations cannot run .",June
Rachel Maddow,Hold on. I’m going to give you 10 additional seconds because the question is what if the court has already overturned Roe and Roe is gone? All of the things you just described would be to try to preserve Roe. If Roe is gone what could you do as president to preserve abortion rights?,June
Bernie Sanders,"Well, first of all, let me tell you this. It didn’t even come up yet but let’s taste this. Medicare For All guarantees every woman in this country the right to have an abortion if she wants it.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Thank you, Senator.",June
Kirsten G.,"Can I just address this for a second? I want to talk directly, directly, to America’s women and the men who love them. Women’s reproductive rights are under assault by President Trump and the Republican party. 30 states are trying to overturn Roe v Wade right now.",June
Kirsten G.,"It is mind-boggling to me that we are debating this on this stage in 2019 among Democrats whether women should have access to reproductive rights. I think we have to stop playing defense and start playing offense. Let me tell you one thing about politics because it goes to the corruption and the deal making. When the door is closed and the negotiations are made there are conversations about women’s rights and compromises have been made on our backs. That’s how we got to Hyde. That’s how the Hyde Amendment was created, a compromise by leaders of both parties.",June
Kirsten G.,"Then we have the ACA. During the ACA negotiation I had to fight like heck with other women to make sure that contraception wasn’t sold down the river or abortion services. What we need to know is … Imagine this one question. When we beat President Trump and Mitch McConnell walks into the Oval Office, God forbid, to do negotiations who do you want when that door closes to be sitting behind that desk to fight for women’s rights?",June
Kirsten G.,I have been the fiercest advocate for women’s reproductive freedom for over a decade. I promise you as president when that door closes I will guarantee women’s reproductive freedom no matter what.,June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator, thank you.",June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you. We’re moving to climate. We’re moving to climate, guys. Senator Harris, I’m addressing you first on this. You live in a state that has been hit by drought, wildfires, flooding. Climate change is a major concern for voters in your state. It’s pretty obvious. Obviously the state as well.",June
Chuck Todd,Last night voters heard many of the candidates weigh in on their proposals. Explain specifically what yours is.,June
Kamala Harris,"Well, first of all, I don’t even call it climate change. It’s the climate crisis. It represents an existential threat to us as a species. The fact that we have a President of the United States who has embraced science fiction over science fact would be to our collective peril.",June
Kamala Harris,I visited while the embers were smoldering the wildfires in California. I spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning.,June
Kamala Harris,On this issue it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now. That is why I support a Green New Deal. It is why I believe on day one and as president I will reenter us in the Paris Agreement because we have to take these issues seriously.,June
Kamala Harris,"Frankly, we have a President of the United States … We talked about, you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the United States? It’s Donald Trump.",June
Kamala Harris,"I’m going to tell you why, I’m going to tell you why, because I agree climate change represents an existential threat. He denies the science. You want to talk about North Korea? A real threat in terms of nuclear arsenal but what does he do? He embraces Kim Jong-Un, a dictator for the sake of a photo op. Putin, you want …",June

Chuck Todd,"Thank you, Senator Harris. Mayor Buttigieg, in your climate plan, if you’re elected President, in your first term, how is this going to help farmers impacted by climate change in the Midwest?",June
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, the reality is, we need to begin adapting right away, but we also can’t skip a beat on preventing climate change from getting even worse. It’s why we need aggressive and ambitious measures. It’s why we need to do a carbon tax and dividend, but I would propose we do it in a way that is rebated out to the American people in a progressive fashion so that most Americans are made more than whole.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"This isn’t theoretical for us in south Indiana. Parts of California on fire, right here in Florida they’re talking about sea level rise. Well, in Indiana, I had to activate the Emergency Operations Center of our city twice in less than two years. First time was a 1,000 year flood, and the next time was a 500 year flood. This is not just happening on the Arctic ice caps. This is happening in the middle of the country and we’ve got to be dramatically more aggressive moving forward.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"Now here’s what very few people talk about. First of all, rural American can be part of the solution instead of being told they’re part of the problem. With the right kind of soil management and other kind of investments, rural America could be a huge part of how we get this done. Secondly, we got to look to the leadership of local communities.

Lots of your colleagues on stage tonight have talked about moving away from fossil fuels entirely. Can oil and gas companies be real partners in this fight?",June
John H.,"Well, I share the sense of urgency. I’m a scientist, so I recognize that within 10 or 12 years of actually suffering irreversible damage, but you know, guaranteeing everybody a government job is not going to get us there. Socialism, in that sense, is not the solution. We have to look at what really will make a difference.",June
John H.,"In Colorado, we’re closing a couple coal plants, replacing them with wind, solar, and batteries and the monthly bills go down. We’ve building a network for electric vehicles. We are working with the oil and gas industry, and we created the first methane regulations in the country. Methane is 25 times worse than CO2. Then we’ve got to get to that last part. I mean, the industrial, heavy industry, we haven’t seen the plans yet.",June
John H.,"If you look at the real problems, CO2, the worst polluters in CO2 was China, it was the United States, and then it’s concrete and it’s extallation. Beyond that, I think we’ve got to recognize that only by bringing people together, businesses, non-profits, we can’t demonize every business. We’ve got to bring them together to be part of this thing, because ultimately-",June

John H.,"If we’re not able to do that, we will be doomed to failure. We have no way of doing this without-",June
Rachel Maddow,"Governor, thank you. Vice President Biden, on the issue of how you do this, Democrats are arguing robustly among themselves about what’s the best way to tackle climate change. But if we’re honest, many Republicans, including the President, are still not sure if they believe it is even a serious problem. So, are there significant ways you can cut carbon emissions if you have to do it with no support from Congress?",June
Joe Biden,"The answer is yes. Number one, when our administration, we built the largest wind farm in the world, the largest solar energy facility in the world. We drove down the price, competitive price, of both of those renewable sources. I would immediately insist that we, in fact, build 500,000 recharging stations throughout the United States of America, working with Governors, Mayors, and others, so that we can go to a full electric vehicle future by the year 2030.",June
Joe Biden,"I would make that we invested $400 million dollars in new science and technology to be the exporter, not only of the green economy, but economy that can create millions of jobs. But I would immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. I would up the ante in that Accord, which it calls for, because we make up 15% of the problem. 85% of the world makes up the rest. We have to have someone that knows how to corral the rest of the world, bring them together, and get something done like we did in our administration.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Sanders, I want to give you 30 seconds to follow up, but I’m going to hold you to 30.",June
Bernie Sanders,"Look, the old ways are no longer relevant. The scientists tell us we have 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet. This is a global issue. What the President of the United States should do is not deny the reality of climate change, but tell the rest of the world that instead of spending a trillion and a half dollars on weapons of destruction, let us get together for the common enemy, and that is to transform the world energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.",June

Steve Kornacki,"All right, well on Election Day 2020, Donald Trump will be something he was not on Election Day 2016. That is, President Donald Trump, and incumbent, running for re-election. In some ways, a re-election campaign for a President, of course, becomes a referendum on how folks feel the President did during his four years in office.",June
Steve Kornacki,"So what can we say about how voters have been reacting so far to the Trump Presidency? Well, what you see here, this is his average approval rating, meaning you’ve always got these different polls out there. One day, NBC will have one. The next day, CNN will have one. They’re always coming in from all over the place. This trend line is an average, a day-to-day average of all of those polls, put together. What you see here in this trend line is it’s a very narrow range that Trump is operating in. What I mean by that is look at this. This is his high watermark, his peak, as President. His average approval rating at its best, 46%. When was this? Early February 2017. That was his honeymoon. He had just become President. That makes him different right there from every modern predecessor he has because all of them have gotten to 60, 65, 70%, at least for a short period. They all had honeymoons. Trump’s honeymoon, he couldn’t even crack 50%. So already, we see a lower ceiling for Trump than we’ve seen with past Presidents, but that comes with a flip side.",June
Steve Kornacki,"That is the basement for Trump. Look at this. 37% is the low point he’s hit in his average approval rating as President. That is actually not as low as some of his predecessors have gone. We’ve seen Nixon, Bush Senior, Carter, we saw them fall into the 20’s at some point during their term. That has not happened to Trump, either. 37 on the low end, 46 on the high end. Right now, somewhere in between. It’s a very narrow range. It speaks to polarization. I’ll tell you, it speaks to something else.",June
Steve Kornacki,"Is this Presidency really any different politically in terms of how it’s being received than the campaign in 2016, because compare this trend line. 46, 37, low, high, compare that to Trump’s support against Hillary Clinton in the polls in the Fall of 2016. Trump’s average support, at a low point, 36%. At a high point, about 43.5%. Of course, on Election Day, what was the number he hit? 46%, the same high watermark he’s had in his approval rating, so Trump has been operating in the same range as a candidate, as President. We say it speaks to polarization.",June
Steve Kornacki,"It also speaks to… Look, this is somebody who succeeded as candidate in 2016 despite some very, very high negative numbers. What I mean by that is look at this, the exit poll on Election Day. “Do you think Donald Trump is qualified to be President?” Only 38% said they thought he was qualified for the job. The clear majority said Trump wasn’t qualified. Does he have the temperament? 35% said he had the temperament. Do you like him, do you have a favorable view? Only 40% did. You’re not supposed to be able to win with those numbers. Trump was one of the big reasons his opponent, Hillary Clinton, by Election Day 2016, almost as unpopular as he was, only 43% favorable. It created that narrow path for Trump, and that becomes the question when you look at that approval rating now. In 2020, can he make his opponent as unpopular on Election Day as Clinton was in ’16?",June

Rachel Maddow,"Congressman Swalwell, among this field of candidates, you have a unique position on gun reform. You’re proposing that the government should buy back every assault weapon in America and it should be mandatory. How do you envision that working, especially in states where gun rights are a strong flashpoint?",June
Eric Swalwell,"Keep your pistols, keep your rifles, keep your shotguns, but we can take the most dangerous weapons from the most dangerous people. We have the NRA on the ropes because of the moms, because of the Brady Group, because of Gifford’s, because of March for our Lives. But I’m the only candidate on this stage calling for a ban and buyback of every single assault weapon in America. I’ve seen the plans of the other candidates here. They would all leave 15 million assault weapons in our communities. They wouldn’t do a single thing to save a single life in Parkland. I’ll approach this issue as a prosector. I’ll approach it as the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks, but also, as a parent of a generation who sends our children to school where we look at what they’re wearing so we remember it in case we have to identify them later… a generation who has seen thousands of Black children killed in our streets, and a generation who goes to the theater, and we actually look where the fire exits are.",June

Bernie Sanders,That’s a mis-characterization of my thinking.,June
Rachel Maddow,It’s a quote of you.,June
Bernie Sanders,"Look, we have a gun crisis right now. 40,000 people a year are getting killed. In 1988, Rachel, when it wasn’t popular, I ran on a platform of banning assault weapons, and in fact, lost that race for Congress. I have a D minus voting record from the NRA and I believe that what we need is comprehensive gun legislation that, among other things, provides universal background. We end the gun show loophole. We end the straw man provision. I believed in 1988, and I believe today that assault weapons  are weapons are from the military and that they should not be on the streets of America.",June

Rachel Maddow,"Senator Harris, we’re going to give you 30 seconds.",June
Kamala Harris,"Thank you. I think your idea is a great one, Congressman Swalwell. I will say that there a lot of great ideas. The problem is Congress has not had the courage to act, which is why when elected President of the United States, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to pull their act together, bring all these good ideas together, and put a bill on my desk for signature. If they do not, I will take executive action, and I will put in place the most comprehensive background check policy we’ve had. I will require the ATF to take the licenses of gun dealers who violate the law, and I will ban, by executive order, the importation of assault weapons, because I’m going to tell you, as a prosecutor, I have seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers who are the mothers of homicide victims. I have attended more police officer funerals. It is enough. It is enough. There have been plenty of good ideas from members of the United States Congress. There’s been no action. As President, I will take action.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Mayor Buttigieg, I want to bring you in on this, sir. A lot of discussion about assault rifles that are often short-handed as military style weapons. You’re the only person on this stage tonight with military experience as veteran of the Afghanistan War. Will military families… Does that inform you thinking on this view? Do you believe that military families or American’s veterans will, at large, have a different take on this than the other Americans who we’ve been talking about and who Congressman Swalwell is appealing to with his buyback program?",June
Pete Buttigieg,"Yes, of course, because we trained on some of these kinds of weapons. Look, every part of my life experience informs this. Being the Mayor of a city where the worst part of the job is dealing with violence, we lose as many as were lost at Parkland every two or three years in my city alone. This is tearing communities apart.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"If more guns made us safer, we’d be the safest country on earth. It doesn’t work that way. Common sense measures like universal background checks can’t seem to get delivered by Washington, even when most Republicans, let alone most Americans, agree it’s the right thing to do. As somebody who trained on weapons of war, I can tell you that there are weapons that have absolutely no place in American cities or neighborhoods in peace time, ever.",June

Number two, we increase that background check  during the Obama-Biden administration. I’m also the only guy that got assault weapons banned. Banned. And the number of clips in a gun banned. So folks, look, and I would buyback those weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think-",June
Joe Biden,"… As weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think it can be done and it should be demanded that we do it, and that’s a good expenditure of money. And lastly, we should have smart guns. No gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger. It’s within our right to do that, we can do that.

Here’s one that came from  from Canby, Oregon, who writes, “Many fear the current administration has inflicted irrevocable harm on our governing institutions and norms, and in the process, on our reputation abroad. The question is, what do you see as important early steps in reversing the damage done?” And we’ll put this one to Senator Bennet.",June
Michael Bennet,"Thank you very much. What an excellent question. First of all, we have to restore our democracy out home. The rest of the world is looking for us for leadership. We have a president who doesn’t believe in the rule of law, he doesn’t believe in freedom of the press, he doesn’t believe in independent judiciary. He believes in the corruption that he’s brought to Washington D.C., and that is what we have to change, and that’s why everybody is up here tonight. And I appreciate the fact that they’re up here for that reason.",June
Michael Bennet,"Second, we’ve got to restore the relationships that he’s destroyed with our allies. Not just in Europe, he flew to the G20 last night and attacked Japan, Germany, and a third ally of ours without saying anything about North Korea or Russia. When you’ve got a situation where you have a president who says something happened in the Straits of Hormuz and the whole world doesn’t know whether to believe it or not, that is a huge problem when it comes to the national security of the United States of America.",June
Chuck Todd,This is a perfect time-,June
Michael Bennet,And we need to change that.,June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you, Senator. That is a perfect for me to do another one of these down the line. And this is what this question is, which is you got to have to … You’re likely going to have to reset a relationship between America and another country or entity if you become president because of, perhaps because of some relationship that you just mentioned about President Trump.

Rachel Maddow,"Last question for Vice President Biden tonight. You have made your decades of experience in foreign policy a pillar of your campaign. But when the time came to say “yes” or “no” on one of the most consequential foreign policy decisions of the last century, you voted for the Iraq war. You have since said you regret that vote. But why should voters trust your judgment when it comes to making a decision about taking the country to war the next time?",June
Joe Biden,"Because once the Bush abused that power. What happened was we got elected after that. I made sure the President turned to me and said, “Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq.” I was responsible for getting 150,000 combat troops out of Iraq and my son was one of them. I also think we should not have combat troops in Afghanistan. It’s long overdue. It should end. And thirdly, I believe that you’re not going to find anybody who has pulled together more of our alliances to deal with with what is the real stateless threat out there. We cannot go it alone in terms of dealing with terrorism. So, I’d eliminate the act that allowed us to go into war and not the AUMF, and make sure that it could only be used for what it’s intent was, and that is to go after terrorists. But never do it alone.",June
Joe Biden,"That’s why we have to repair our alliances. We put together 65 countries to make sure we dealt with ISIS in Iraq and other places. That’s what I would do, that’s what I have done. And I know how to do it.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Sanders, 30 seconds.",June
Bernie Sanders,"One of the differences … One of the differences that Joe and I have in our record is Joe voted for that war. I helped lead the opposition to that war, which is a total disaster. Second of all, I helped lead the effort for the first time to utilize the War Powers Act, to get the United States out of the sorely- led intervention in Yemin, which is the most horrific humanitarian disaster on Earth. And thirdly, let me be very clear, I will do everything I can to prevent a war with Iran, which would be far worse than disastrous war with Iraq.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Sanders, thank you.",June
Joe Biden,You can’t go to war without informed consent of the American people.,June
Chuck Todd,"All right, guys. We got … Good news is you get more time to talk, but I have to sneak in one more break.",June
Rachel Maddow,We’ll be right back.,June
Chuck Todd,We’ll be right back with more debate.,June
Chuck Todd,(silence),June
Steve Kornacki,"Well, here it is. This is the month to start looking at on your calendar. February 2020. That’s when all the talk ends and the voting begins and that massive, gigantic, enormous democratic presidential field, it gets thinned down, and maybe by the end of that month we’ll even have a pretty good sense who the nominee’s going to be. You know, Iowa, always in that lead-off position. The Iowa caucuses, there it is. Monday, February 3rd. The race begins in Iowa. And then traditionally, it is an eight-day stretch from Iowa to New Hampshire. First caucuses in Iowa, first primary in New Hampshire eight days later. So, you expect however many candidates are left when they get to the starting line in Iowa, there’s probably going to be far fewer eight later. Between Iowa and New Hampshire, you can expect a lot of winnowing to take place. You’ll have some clear candidates who are out in front, as well.",June
Steve Kornacki,"The next stop, this is a new one on the democratic … A relatively new one, only the last couple cycles. Nevada, caucuses in Nevada, that’s the next one. And then the big one, obviously, the South Carolina primary. The first in the South primary at the end of the month. And of course, South Carolina, very important because this is the first date where you’re going to have a really substantial black population voting. 60%, more than 60% of the Democratic electorate in the 2016 South Carolina primary was African American. So, a key test there.",June
Steve Kornacki,"Four individual contests. We’ll talk only about these states the nights they come in. That’s going to be February, but then flip the calendar. From the last day of February, look at this. Go into March. Just a couple days later, Super Tuesday. Super Tuesday, let me give you a sense of what that looks like. Massive, enormous. You go from one contest at a time, all in the same … You got California, you got Texas, you got a bunch in the South. You got Massachusetts, Minnesota. All of these states all at once. So, February’s going to produce some clarity in terms of who is a contender. Super Tuesday, mega primary, that could give us some real answers potentially in early March.",June
Steve Kornacki,( silence),June
Lester Holt,We are back from Miami. Now each candidate will have a final chance to make their case to the voters. 45 seconds each. We begin with Congressman Swalwell.,June
Eric Swalwell,"We can’t be a forward-looking party if we look to the past for our leadership. I’m a congressman, but also a father of a two-year old and an infant. When I’m not changing diapers, I’m changing Washington. Most of the time, the diapers smell better. I went into Congress at 31 and I found a Washington that doesn’t work for people like you and me. It’s made of the rich and the disconnected. I was the first in my family to go to college and have student loan debt. So, I have led the effort to elect the next generation of members of Congress and we have a moment to seize. This is a can-do generation. This is the generation that will end climate chaos. This is the generation that will solve student loan debt and this is the generation that will say, “Enough is enough” and end gun violence. This generation demands bold solutions. That’s why I’m running for president.",June
Lester Holt,"Congressman, thank you.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Mrs. Williamson, 45 seconds for your closing statements.",June
Marianne W.,"I’m sorry we haven’t talked more tonight about how we’re going to beat Donald Trump. I have an idea about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is not going to be beaten just by insider politics talk. He’s not going to be beaten just by somebody who has plans. He’s going to be beaten by somebody who has an idea of what this man has done. This man has reached into the psyche of the American people and he’s harnessed fear for political purposes. So, Mr. President, if you’re listening, I want you to hear me please. You have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out. So, I, sir, I have a feeling you know what you’re doing. I’m going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field and sir, love will win.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Mrs. Williamson, thank you.",June
Chuck Todd,Senator Bennet.,June
Michael Bennet,"Thank you. Thank you. My mom and her parents came to the United States to rebuilt their shattered lives in the only country that they could. 300 years before that, my parent’s family came searching religious freedom here. The ability for one generation to do better than the next is now severely at risk in the United States, especially among children living in poverty like the ones I used to work for in the Denver public schools. That’s why I’m running for president. I’ve had two tough races in Colorado, but by bringing people people together, not by making empty promises. And I believe we need to build a broad coalition of Americans to beat Donald Trump, end the corruption in Washington, and build a new era of American democracy and American opportunity.",June
Michael Bennet,"This is going to be hard to do, but it’s what our parent’s would have expected, it’s what our kids deserve.",June
Chuck Todd,Senator.,June
Michael Bennet,I hope you’ll join me in this effort. Thank you.,June
Chuck Todd,Thank you. Governor Hickenlooper.,June
John H.,"I’m a small business owner who brought that same scrappy spirit to big Colorado, one of the most progressive states in America. We expanded reproductive health to reduce teenage abortion by 64%. We were the first state to legalize marijuana and we transformed our justice system in the progress. We passed universal background checks in a purple state. We got to near universal healthcare coverage. We attacked climate change with the toughest method and regulations in the country, and for the last three years, we’ve been the number one economy in America.",June
John H.,"You don’t need big government to do big things. I know that because I’m the one person up here who’s actually done the big progressive things everyone else is talking about. If we turn towards socialism, we run the risk of helping to re-elect the worst president in American history.",June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you, Governor.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Gillibrand, you have the floor for 45 seconds.",June
Kirsten G.,"Women in America … Women in America are on fire. We’ve marched, we’ve organized, we’ve run for office, and we’ve won. But our rights are under attack like never before by President Trump and the Republicans who want to repeal Roe v. Wade, which is why I went to the front lines in Georgia to fight for them. As president, I will take on the fights that no one else will. I stood up to the Pentagon and repealed Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. I’ve stood up to the banks and voted against the bailout twice. I’ve stood up to Trump more than any other senator in the U.S. Senate and I have the most comprehensive approach for getting money out of politics with publicly-funded elections to deal with political corruption.",June
Kirsten G.,"Now is not the time to play it safe. Now is not the time to be afraid of first. We need a president who will take on the big challenges, even if she stands alone. Join me in fighting for this.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Gillibrand, thank you.",June
Lester Holt,"Mr. Yang, you have 45 seconds for your closing.",June
Andrew Yang,"First, I want to thank everyone who put me on this stage tonight. I am proof that our democracy still works. Democrats and Americans around the country have one question for their nominee, and that is, “Who can beat Donald Trump in 2020?” That is the right question and the right candidate to beat Donald Trump will be solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected, and will have a vision of a trickle-up economy that is already drawing thousands of disaffected Trump voters, conservatives, independents, and libertarians, as well as democrats and progressives. I am that candidate. I can build a much broader coalition to beat Donald Trump. It is not left, it is not right, it is forward, and that is where I’ll talk the country in 2020.",June
Lester Holt,"Mr. Yang, thank you.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Harris. Senator Harris, the floor is yours.",June
Kamala Harris,"00 a.m. agenda that is about everything from what we need to do to deliver healthcare to how you will be able to pay the bills by the end of the month. When I think about what our country needs, I promise you I will be a president who leads with a sense of dignity, with honesty, speaking the truth, and giving the American family all that they need to get through the end of the month in a way that allows them to prosper.",June
Kamala Harris,"So, I hope to earn your support. Please join us kamalaharris.org.",June
Rachel Maddow,"Senator, thank you.",June
Chuck Todd,"Mayor Buttigieg, 45 seconds.",June
Pete Buttigieg,"Nothing about politics is theoretical for me. I’ve had the experience of writing a letter to my family, putting it in an envelope marked “just in case”, and leaving it where they would know where to find it in case I didn’t come back from Afghanistan. I’ve experience with being in a marriage that exists by the grace of a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court. I have the experience of guiding a community where the per capita income was below $20,000 when I took office into a brighter future. I’m running because the decisions we make in the next three or four years are going to decide how the next 30 or 40 go. When I get to the current age of the current president in the year 2055, I want to be able to look back on these years and say, “My generation delivered climate solutions, racial equality, and an end to endless war.” Help me deliver that new generation to Washington before it’s too late.",June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you. Senator Sanders, 45 seconds. The floor is yours.",June
Bernie Sanders,"I suspect people all over the country who are watching this debate are saying, “These are good people. They have great ideas.” But how come nothing really change? How come for the last 45 years wages have been stagnant for the middle class? How come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty? How come 45 million people still have student debt? How come three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America? And here is the answer. Nothing will change unless we have the guts to take on Wall Street, the insurance industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the military industrial complex, and the fossil fuel industry. If we don’t have the guts to take them on, we’ll continue to have plans, we’ll continue to have talk, and the rich will get richer, and everybody else will be struggling.",June
Chuck Todd,"Thank you, Senator.",June
Rachel Maddow,"And lastly, we’ll hear from Vice President Biden. Sir, you have 45 seconds.",June
Joe Biden,Thank you very much. I’m ready to lead this country because I think it’s important we restore the soul of this nation. This president has ripped it out. He’s the only president in our history who has equated racist and white supremacist with ordinary and decent people. He’s the only president who has in fact engaged and embraced dictators and thumbed their nose at our allies. I’m secondly running for president because I think we have to restore the backbone of America. The poor and hardworking middle class people. You can’t do that without replacing them with the dignity they once had.,June
Joe Biden,"Lastly, we’ve got to unite the United States of America as much as anybody says we can’t. If we do, there’s not a single thing the American people can’t do. This is the United States of America. We can do anything if we’re together. Together. So, God bless you all and may God protect our troops.",June

Jake Tapper,"Welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Debate. Candidates, we’re about to begin opening statements, but first overview of the ground rules that your campaigns agreed to earlier this month to ensure a fair debate. As moderators, we will attempt to guide the discussion.",July
Jake Tapper,"You will each receive one minute to answer questions, 30 seconds for responses in rebuttals and 15 additional seconds if a moderator asks for a clarification. The timing lights will remind you of these limits. Please respect that and please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates during their allotted time.",July
Jake Tapper,A candidate infringing on another candidate’s time will have his or her time reduced. We also want to ask our audience inside the historic Fox theater to remain silent when the candidates are actively debating. The candidates need to be able to hear the questions and hear one another,July
Diana,"Time now for opening statements, you’ll each receive one minute. Governor Steve Bullock, please begin.",July
Steve Bullock,"Thanks Diana. I come from a state where a lot of people voted for Donald Trump. Let’s not kid ourselves. He will be hard to beat. Yet watching that last debate, folks seem more concerned about scoring points or are doing each other with wishlist economics.",July
Steve Bullock,"Then making sure Americans know we hear their voices and it will help their lives. Look, I’m a pro choice, pro union, populist Democrat, that won three elections in a red state. Not by compromising our values, but by getting stuff done. That’s how we win back the places we lost.",July
Steve Bullock,"Showing up, listening, focusing on the challenges of every day Americans. That farmers are getting hit right now by Trump’s trade wars, that teacher work in a second job just to afford her insulin. They can’t wait for revolution. Their problems are on the here and now.",July
Steve Bullock,I’m a progressive. Emphasis on progress and I’m running for president to get stuff done for all of those Americans Washington has left behind.,July
Diana,Marianne Williamson.,July
Marianne W.,"Thank you. In 1776 our founders brought forth on this planet an extraordinary new possibility. It was the idea that people, no matter who they were, would simply have the possibility of thriving. We have not ever totally actualized this ideal, but at the times when we have done best, we have tried.",July
Marianne W.,"And when forces have opposed them, generations of Americans have risen up and pushed back against those forces. We did that with abolition and with women’s suffrage and with civil rights and now it is time, a generation of Americans to rise up again.",July
Marianne W.,"For an amoral economic system has turned short term profits for huge multinational corporations into a false god and this new false god takes precedence over the safety and the health and the wellbeing of we, the American people and the people of the world and the planet on which we live. Conventional politics will not solve this problem because conventional politics is part of the problem. We, the American people must rise up and do what we do best and create a new possibility. Say no to what we don’t want and yes to what we know can be true.",July
Marianne W.,I’m Marianne Williamson and that’s why I’m running for president.,July
Diana,Congressman John Delaney.,July
John Delaney,"Folks, we have a choice. We can go down the road that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren want to take us with bad policies like Medicare for All, free everything and impossible promises that’ll turn off independent voters and get Trump reelected. That’s what happened with McGovern. That’s what happened with Mondale.",July
John Delaney,That’s what happened with Dukakis. Or we can nominate someone with new ideas to create universal healthcare for every American with choice. Someone who wants to unify our country and grow the economy and create jobs everywhere and then we win the White House. I’m the product of the American Dream.,July
John Delaney,"I believe in it. I’m the grandson of immigrants, the son of a construction worker. My wife April, and I have four amazing daughters. I was the youngest CEO in the history of the New York Stock Exchange, created thousands of jobs and then served in Congress.",July
John Delaney,"That’s the type of background and my platform is about real solutions, not impossible promises that can beat Trump and govern. Thank you.",July
Diana,Congressman Tim Ryan.,July
Tim Ryan,"America is great, but not everyone can access America’s greatness. The systems that were built to lift us up are now suffocating the American people. The economic system that used to create 30, 40, $50 an hour jobs that you can have a good solid middle-class living, now force us to have two or three jobs just to get by.",July
Tim Ryan,"Most families when they go to sit at the kitchen table to do their bills, they get a pit in the middle of their stomach. We deserve better. And the political system is broken too because the entire conversation is about left or right. Where are you at on the political system and I’m here to say this isn’t about left or right.",July
Tim Ryan,"This is about new and better. And it’s not about reforming old systems. It’s about building new systems and tonight I will offer solutions that are bold, that are realistic and that are a clean break from the past.",July
Diana,Governor John Hickenlooper.,July
John H.,"Last year, Democrats flipped 40 Republican seats in the house and not one of those 40 Democrats supported the policies of our front runners at center stage. Now I share their progressive values, but I’m a little more pragmatic. I was out of work for two whole years until I started what became the largest brew club in America.",July
John H.,"And I learned the small business lessons of how to provide service and teamwork and became a top mayor. And as governor of Colorado created the number one economy in the country, we also expanded healthcare, reproductive rights. We attacked climate change head on, we beat the NRA. We did not build massive government expansions.",July
John H.,"Now, some will promise that we’ll tonight or a plan for tonight. Where we focused on was making sure that we got people together to get things done, to provide solutions to problems, to make sure that we worked together and created jobs. That’s how we’re going to beat Donald Trump. That’s how we’re going to win Michigan and the country.",July
Diana,Senator Amy Klobuchar.,July
Amy Klobuchar,"Let’s get real. Tonight we debate, but ultimately we have to beat Donald Trump. My background, it’s a little different than his. I stand before you today as a granddaughter of an iron ore miner, as a daughter of a union teacher and a newspaper man.",July
Amy Klobuchar,"As the first woman elected to the US Senate from the state of Minnesota and a candidate for president of the United States. That’s because we come from a country of shared dreams and I have had it with the racist attacks. I have had it with a president that says one thing on TV, that has your back and then you get home and you see those charges for prescription drugs and cable and college.",July
Amy Klobuchar,"You’re going to hear a lot of promises up here, but I’m going to tell you this. Yes, I have bold ideas, but they are grounded in reality and yes, I will make some simple promises. I can win this. I’m from the Midwest and I have won every race, every place, every time, and I will govern with integrity, the integrity worthy of the extraordinary people of this nation.",July
Diana,"Congressman Beto O’Rourke,",July
Beto O’Rourke,"I’m running for president because I believe that America discovers its greatness at its moments of greatest need. This moment will define us forever and I believe that in this test, America will be redeemed. In the face of cruelty and fear from a lawless president, we will choose to be the nation that stands up for the human rights of everyone, for the rule of law for everyone.",July
Beto O’Rourke,"And a democracy that serves everyone. Whatever our differences, we know that before we are anything else, we are Americans first. And we will ensure that each one of us is well enough and educated enough and paid enough to realize our full potential. We will meet these challenges here at home and we will lead the world in those that we face abroad.",July
Beto O’Rourke,"Successfully confronting endless war and climate change. At this moment of truth, let us pursue our national promise and make a more perfect union of everyone, by everyone and for everyone.",July
Diana,Mayor Pete Buttigieg.,July
Pete Buttigieg,I’m running for president because our country is running out of time. It is even bigger than the emergency of the Trump presidency. Ask yourself how somebody like Donald Trump ever gets within cheating distance as the Oval Office in the first place. It doesn’t happen unless America is already in a crisis.,July
Pete Buttigieg,"An economy that’s not working for everyone, endless war, climate change. We have lived this. In my industrial Midwestern hometown, my generation has lived this as long as we have been alive. And it’s only accelerated. Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate.",July
Pete Buttigieg,"By 2030 the average house in this country will cost half a million bucks and a woman’s right to choose may not even exist. We’re not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments, policies, and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive.",July
Pete Buttigieg,We’ve got to summon the courage to walk away from the past and do something different. This is our shot. That is why I’m running for president.,July
Diana,Senator Elizabeth Warren.,July
Elizabeth W.,"Donald Trump disgraces the office of president every single day. And anyone on this stage tonight or tomorrow night would be a far better president. I promise no matter who our candidate is, I will work my heart out to beat Donald Trump and to elect a democratic Congress, but all problems didn’t start with Donald Trump.",July
Elizabeth W.,"Donald Trump is part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else. We’re not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness. We’re going to solve them by being the Democratic Party of big structural change.",July
Elizabeth W.,"We need to be the party that fights for our democracy and our economy to work for everyone. I know what’s broken in this country. I know how to fix it, and I will fight to make it happen.",July
Diana,Senator Bernie Sanders.,July
Bernie Sanders,"Tonight, in America as we speak, 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured, but the healthcare industry made a $100 billion in profits last year. Tonight, as we speak right now, 500,000 Americans are sleeping out on the street, and yet companies like Amazon that made billions in profits, did not pay one nickel in federal income tax.",July
Bernie Sanders,"Tonight, half of the American people are living paycheck to paycheck, and yet 49% of all new income goes to the top 1%. Tonight, the fossil fuel industry continues to receive 100s of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks while they destroy this planet.",July
Bernie Sanders,"We have got to take on Trump’s racism, his sexism, xenophobia, and come together in an unprecedented grassroots movement to not only defeat Trump, but to transform our economy and our government.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. Let’s start the debate with the number one issue for Democratic voters, healthcare. And Senator Sanders, let’s start with you. You support Medicare for All, which would eventually take private health insurance away for more than 150 million Americans in exchange for government sponsored healthcare for everyone.",July
Jake Tapper,Congressman Delaney just referred to it as bad policy and previously he has called the idea political suicide that will just get president Trump reelected. What do you say to Congressman Delaney?,July
Bernie Sanders,"You’re wrong. Right now we have a dysfunctional healthcare system, 87 million uninsured or under-insured, 500,000 Americans every year going bankrupt because of medical bills. 30,000 people dying while the healthcare industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit.",July
Bernie Sanders,"Five minutes away from here John is a country. It’s called Canada. They guarantee health care to every man, woman, and child as a human right. They spend half of what we spent. And by the way, when you end up in a hospital in Canada, you come out with no bill at all. Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege.",July
Bernie Sanders,"I believe that, I will fight for that.",July
Jake Tapper,Thank you Senator Sanders. Congressman Delaney.,July
John Delaney,"Well, I’m right about this. We can create a universal healthcare system to give everyone basic healthcare for free and I have a proposal to do it. But we don’t have to go around and be the party of subtraction and telling half the country who has private health insurance that their health insurance is illegal.",July
John Delaney,"My Dad, the union electrician, loved the healthcare he got from the IBEW. He would never want someone to take that away. Half of Medicare beneficiaries now have Medicare advantage, which is private insurance or supplemental plans. It’s also bad policy. It’ll underfund the industry.",July
Jake Tapper,Thank you Congressman.,July
John Delaney,Many hospitals will close and it’s bad policy.,July
Jake Tapper,"Senator Sanders, I want to-",July
Elizabeth W.,My name was also mentioned in this-,July
Jake Tapper,"We’re going to come to you in one second, but let me go to Senator Sanders right now. Senator Sanders.",July
Bernie Sanders,"The fact of the matter is tens of millions of people lose their health insurance every single year when they change jobs, when their employer changes that insurance. If you want stability in the health care system, if you want a system which gives you freedom of choice with regard to doctor or hospital.",July
Bernie Sanders,"Which is a system which will not bankrupt you, the answer is to get rid of the profiteering of the drug companies-",July
Jake Tapper,.,July
Bernie Sanders,And the insurance companies-,July
Jake Tapper,Thank you sir.,July
Bernie Sanders,… -,July
Elizabeth W.,.,July
John Delaney,"But now he’s talking about a different issue. What I’m talking about is really simple. We should deal with the tragedy of the uninsured and give everyone healthcare as a right, but why do we got to be the party of taking something away from?",July
Elizabeth W.,No. No one is the party-,July
Jake Tapper,.,July
John Delaney,That’s what they’re running on. They’re running on telling half the country that your health insurance is illegal. It says it right in the bill. We don’t have to do that. We can give everyone healthcare and allow people to have choice. That’s the American way.,July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Congressman. Senator Warren.",July
Elizabeth W.,"So look, let’s be clear about this. We are the Democrats. We are not about trying to take away healthcare from anyone. That’s what the Republicans are trying to do and we should stop using Republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that health care.",July
Elizabeth W.,"Now, I want to have a chance to tell the story about my friend Eddie Barkat. Eddie is 35 years old. He has a wife, Rachel. He has a cute little boy named Carl. He also has ALS and it’s killing him. And he has health insurance, good health insurance-",July
Jake Tapper,Senator.,July
Elizabeth W.,And it’s not nearly enough.  important-,July
Jake Tapper,"Senator. I’m staying with you. I’m staying with you, but you’ve exceeded your time and so let me just stay with you on Medicare for All.",July
Elizabeth W.,All right.,July
Jake Tapper,"At the last debate you said, your quote with Bernie on Medicare for All. Now Senator Sanders has said that people in the middle class will pay more in taxes to help pay for Medicare for All though that will be offset by the elimination of insurance premiums and other costs.",July
Jake Tapper,Are you also quote with Bernie on Medicare for All when it comes to raising taxes on middle class Americans to pay for it?,July
Elizabeth W.,"So giant corporations and billionaires are going to pay more. Middle class families are going to pay less out of pocket for their health care. And I’d like to finish talking about Eddie, the guy who has ALS. This isn’t funny. This is somebody who has health insurance and is dying. And every month he has about $9,000 in medical bills that his insurance company won’t cover.",July
Elizabeth W.,"His wife, Rachel is on the phone for hours and hours and hours begging the insurance company, “Please cover what the doctors say he needs.” He talks about what it’s like to go online with thousands of other people to beg friends, family and strangers for money so he can cover his medical expenses.",July
Elizabeth W.,The basic model of an insurance company has taken as much money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health care coverage. That is not working-,July
Jake Tapper,Thank you.,July
Elizabeth W.,… for American across this country-,July
Jake Tapper,Thank you Senator.,July
Elizabeth W.,Medicare for All will fix that and that’s why I will fight for it.,July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you Senator. Just a point of clarification, in 15 extra seconds, would you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All? Offset obviously by the elimination of insurance premiums, yes or no?",July
Elizabeth W.,"Costs will go up for billionaires and go up for corporations. For middle class families, cost-",July
Elizabeth W.,"And go up for corporations. For middle class families, total costs will go down.",July
Jake Tapper,"Governor Bullock, I want to bring you in. You do not support Medicare for All. How do you respond to Senator Warren?",July
Steve Bullock,"No. Healthcare is so personal to all of us. Never forget when my 12-year old son had a heart attack within 24 hours of his life, had to be life-flighted to Salt Lake City, but because we had good insurance, he’s here with me tonight. At the end of the day, I’m not going to support any plan that rips away quality healthcare from individuals. This is an example of wishlist economics. It used to be just Republicans wanted to repeal and replace. Now, many Democrats do as well. We can get there with a public option, negotiating drug prices, ending-",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Governor Bullock. I want to bring in Mayor Buttigieg on the topic of whether or not the middle-class should pay higher taxes in exchange for guaranteed healthcare and the elimination of insurance premiums. How do you respond, Mayor?",July
Pete Buttigieg,"So, we don’t have to stand up here speculating about whether the public option or a Medicare for All environment will be better than the corporate options. We can put it to the test. That’s the concept of my Medicare for All who want to proposal. That way, if people like me are right that the public alternative is going to be not only more comprehensive but more affordable than any of the corporate options around there, we’ll see Americans walk away from the corporate options into that Medicare option and it will become Medicare for All without us having to kick anybody off.",July
Jake Tapper,"15 seconds on the clarification. You are willing to raise taxes on middle-class Americans in order to have universal coverage with the disappearance of insurance premiums, yes or no?",July
Pete Buttigieg,I think you can buy into it. That’s the idea of Medicare for All who want it.,July
Pete Buttigieg,"Look, this is a distinction without a difference whether you’re paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums. Look. In this country, if you have health coverage… If you don’t have health coverage, you’re paying too much for care. And if you do have health coverage, you’re paying too much for the care.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. I want to bring in Congressman O’Rourke on the topic of whether the middle-class should pay higher taxes in exchange for universal coverage and the elimination of insurance premiums. What’s your response?",July
Beto O’Rourke,"The answer is no. The middle-class will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every American is guaranteed world-class healthcare. I think we’re being offered a false choice. Some who want to improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins. Others who want a Medicare for All program that will force people off of private insurance. I have a better path, Medicare for America. Everyone who is uninsured is enrolled in Medicare tomorrow. Those who are insufficiently insured are enrolled in Medicare, and those who have employer-sponsored insurance-",July
Beto O’Rourke,"Jake, this is important.",July
Jake Tapper,Who’s offering a false choice here?,July
Beto O’Rourke,"You have some, Governor Bullock, who said that we will improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins with a public option. You have others to my right who are talking about taking away people’s choice for the private insurance they have or members of unions. I was listening to D. Taylor in Nevada. His members want to healthcare that they fought for.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Congressman. Governor Bullock, he just said you’re offering false choice, sir.",July
Steve Bullock,"Congressman, not at all. It took us decades and false starts to get the Affordable Care Act. So, let’s actually build on a public option allowing anyone to buy in. We pay more for prescription drugs than any place actually in the world. We’ve got nothing to show for it. Negotiate prescription drug prices, end surprise medical billing. That’s the way that we can get there without disrupting the lives of 160-million people that like their employer-sponsored health insurance.",July
Jake Tapper,"Congressman O’Rourke, you can respond.",July
Beto O’Rourke,"Every estimate that I’ve seen of expanding ACA even through a public option still leaves millions of people uninsured and also means that people are not guaranteed the health care that they need. As the examples that Senator Warren showed us, our plan ensures that everyone is enrolled in Medicare or can keep their employer-sponsored insurance.",July
Beto O’Rourke,"When we listen to the American people and this is what they want us to do, they want everyone covered, but they want to be able to maintain choice and our plan does that.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Congressman. I wanna bring in Senator Klobuchar. Senator Warren, at the beginning of the night, said that Democrats cannot win the White House with small ideas and spinelessness. In the last debate, she said the politicians who are not supporting Medicare for All simply lack the will to fight for it. You do not support Medicare for All. Is Senator Warren correct. Do you just not lack the will to fight for it?",July
Amy Klobuchar,"That is incorrect. I just have a better way to do this. And in one of my first debates, Jake, I was called a street fighter from the iron range by my opponent. And when she said it, I said, “Thank you.” So, this is what I think we need to get done. We need the public option. That’s what Barack Obama wanted, and it would bring healthcare costs down for everyone. And by the way, I just don’t buy this. I’ve heard some of these candidates say that it’s somehow not moral to not have that public option. Well, Senator Sanders was actually on a public option bill last year and that was, Bernie, the Medicaid public option bill that Senator Schatz introduced. Clearly, this is the easiest way to move forward quickly, and I want to get things done. People can’t wait. I’ve got my friend, Nicole, out there whose son was actually died trying to ration his insulin as a restaurant manager and he died because he didn’t have the enough money to pay for it. And Bernie and I have worked on pharmaceutical  together, and we can get that expensive-",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Sanders… I’m going to go to Senator Sanders and then Senator Warren as you both have mentioned. Senator Sanders.",July
Bernie Sanders,"As the author of the Medicare bill, let me clear up one thing. If People talk about how the insurance, there are millions of people have insurance, they can’t go to the doctor. And when they come out of the hospital, they go bankrupt. All right? What I am talking about and others up here are talking about is no deductibles and no co-payments. And Jake, your question is a Republican talking point. At the end of the day… And by the way, the healthcare industry will be advertising tonight on this program.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Warren, it’s your turn.",July
Bernie Sanders,"Oh. Could I complete that, please?",July
Jake Tapper,"Your time was up, 30 sends.",July
Bernie Sanders,They will be advertising tonight with that talking point.,July
Jake Tapper,Senator Warren.,July
Elizabeth W.,"So, we have to think of this in terms of the big frame. What’s the problem in Washington? It works great for the wealthy. It works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, and it keeps working great for the insurance companies and the drug companies. What it’s going to take is real courage to fight back against them. These insurance companies do not have a god given right to make $23 billion in profits and suck it out of our healthcare system. They do not have a god given right to put forms in place so that people cannot… They want to deny coverage.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator. if we could all just stick to the rules of the time, that would be great. Congressman, Delaney.",July
John Delaney,"I’m the only one on the stage who actually has experience in the healthcare business. And with all due respect, I don’t think my colleagues understand the business. We have the public option, which is great.",July
Bernie Sanders,It’s not a business.,July
John Delaney,"The public option is great, but it doesn’t go far enough. It doesn’t go far enough. I’m proposing universal healthcare where everyone gets healthcare as a basic human right for free, but they have choices. My plan, better care is fully paid for without raising middle-class tax options. So, when we think about this debate, there’s Medicare for All, which is extreme.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Congressman. Thank you, Congressman.",July
John Delaney,I was interrupted. One more thing.,July
Jake Tapper,"I want to bring in Governor Hickenlooper. Governor Hickenlooper, I’d like to hear what you have to say about Senator Warren’s suggestion that those people on the stage who are not in favor of Medicare for All lack the political will to fight for it.",July
John H.,"Well, obviously I disagree with that, as much as I respect both of the senators to my right. I think it comes down to that question of Americans being used to being able to make choices, to have the right to make a decision. And I think proposing a public option that allows some form of Medicare that maybe is a combination of Medicare Advantage and Medicare, that people choose it. And if enough people choose it, it expands, the quality improves, the cost comes down, more people choose it. Eventually, in 15 years, you could get there, but it would be an evolution, not a revolution.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Governor. Senator Warren?",July
Elizabeth W.,"We have tried this experiment with the insurance companies, and what they’ve done is they’ve sucked billions of dollars out of our healthcare system and they force people to have to fight to try to get the healthcare coverage that their doctors and nurses say that they need. Why does everybody… Why does every doctor… Why does every hospital have to fill out so many complicated forms? It’s because it gives insurance companies a chance to say no and to push that cost back on the patients. That’s what we have to fight.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator. I want to bring in Marianne Williamson. Ms. Williamson, how do you respond to the criticism from Senator Warren that you’re not willing to fight for Medicare for All?",July
Marianne W.,"I don’t know if Senator Warren said that about me, specifically. I admire very much what Senator Warren has said and what Bernie has said, but I have to say I have… I’m normally way over there with Bernie and Elizabeth on this one. I hear the others and I have some concern about that as well, and I do have concern about what the Republicans would say and that’s not just a Republican talking point. I do have concern that it will be difficult. I have concerns that it will make it harder to win and I have a concern that it will make it harder to govern because if that’s our big fight, then the Republicans will so shut us down on everything else.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Ms. Williamson. I want to bring in Mayor Buttigieg. Mayor Buttigieg, your response?",July
Pete Buttigieg,"It is time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say. Look, if it’s true that if we embrace a far left agenda, they’re going to say we’re a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what they’re going to do? They’re going to say we’re a bunch of crazy socialists. So, let’s just stand up for the right policy, go out there and defend it. That’s the policy I’m putting forward, not because I think it’s the right triangulation between Republicans here and Democrats there, because I think it’s the right answer for people like my mother-in-law who is here whose life was saved by the ACA, but who was still far too vulnerable to the fact that the insurance industry does not care about her health.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.",July
Jake Tapper,"Senator Sanders, your response?",July
Bernie Sanders,"let’s be clear what this debate is about. Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system. What we are taking on is the fact that over the last 20 years, the drug companies and the insurance companies have spent four and a half billion dollars of your health insurance money on lobbying and campaign contributions. That is why when I went to Canada the other day, people paid 1/10 the price in Canada for insulin that they’re paying in the United States.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator. I want to bring in Congressman Tim Ryan.",July
Jake Tapper,"Congressman Ryan, your response?",July
Tim Ryan,"So, here we are in Detroit, home of the united auto workers. We have all our union friends here tonight. This plan that’s being offered by Senator Warren and Senator Sanders will tell those union members who gave away wages in order to get good healthcare that they’re going to lose their healthcare because Washington’s going to come in and tell them they got a better plan. This is the left and right thing.",July
Tim Ryan,"New and better is this. Move medicare down to 50. Allow people to buy in. Kaiser Permanente said that if those 60-million people do that, they will see a 40% reduction in their healthcare cost. Let businesses buy in, Jake…",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Congressman. So, Senator, let’s talk about that. If Medicare for All is enacted, there are more than 600,000 union members here in Michigan who would be forced to give up their private healthcare plans. Now, I understand that it would provide universal coverage, but can you guarantee those union members that the benefits under Medicare for All will be as good as the benefits that their representatives, their union reps fought hard to negotiate?",July
Bernie Sanders,"Well, two things. They will be better because Medicare for All is comprehensive. It covers all healthcare needs. For senior citizens, it will finally include dental care, hearing aids and eyeglasses.",July
Tim Ryan,But you don’t know that.,July
Bernie Sanders,Second of all…,July
Tim Ryan,"You don’t know that, Bernie.",July
Jake Tapper,"We’ll come to you in a second, Congressman.",July
Bernie Sanders,"I do know it. I wrote the damn bill. And second of all, many of our union brothers and sisters, nobody more pro-union than me up here, are now paying high deductibles and co-payments. And when we do Medicare for All, instead of having the company putting money into healthcare, they can get decent wage increases, which they’re not getting today.",July
Jake Tapper,I want to bring in Congressman Ryan to respond to what Senator Sanders has said.,July
Tim Ryan,"I mean, Senator Sanders does not know all of the union contracts in the United States. I’m trying to explain that these union members are losing their jobs. Their wages have been stagnating. The world is crumbling around them. The only thing they have is possibly really good healthcare, and the democratic message is going to be, “We’re going to go in and the only thing you have left, we’re going to take it and we’re going to do better.” I do not think that’s a recipe for success for us. It’s bad policy and it’s certainly bad politics.",July
Jake Tapper,Congressman Delaney?,July
John Delaney,"So, the bill that Senator Sanders drafted by definition will lower quality in healthcare because it says specifically that the rates will be the same as current Medicare rates, and the data is clear. Medicare does not cover the cost of healthcare. It covers 80% of the cost of healthcare in this country, and private insurance covers 120%. So, if you start underpaying all the healthcare providers, you’re going to create a two-tier market where wealthy people buy their healthcare with cash and the people who are forced, like my dad, the union electrician, will have that healthcare plan taken away from him. They will be forced into and underfunded-",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Congressman. I want to give Senator Sanders a chance to respond.",July
Bernie Sanders,"All right. On the Medicare for All, the hospitals will save substantial sums of money because they’re not going to be spending a fortune doing billing and the other bureaucratic things that they have to do today.",July
John Delaney,I’ve done the math. It doesn’t add up.,July
Bernie Sanders,"Second of all, maybe you did that and made money off of healthcare, but our job is for a nonprofit healthcare system. Furthermore, when we say $500-billion a year by ending all of the incredible complexities that are driving every American crazy, trying to deal with the health insurance companies, hospitals will be better off than they are today.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator. Congressman Delaney, I want to let you have a chance to respond.",July
John Delaney,"Listen. His math is wrong. That’s all I’m saying, that his math is wrong. It’s been well-documented that if all the bills were paid at Medicare rate, which is specifically… I think it’s in section 1200 of their bill, then many hospitals in this country would close. I’ve been going around rural America and I ask rural hospital administrators one question. ” If all your bills were paid at the Medicare rate last year, what would happen?” And they all look at me and say, “We would close.” But the question is, why do we have to be so extreme? Why can’t we just give everyone healthcare as a right and allow them to have choice? I’m starting to think this is not about healthcare. This is an anti-private sector strategy.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Congressman. Thank you, Congressman. We’re going to move on. We’re going to move on to the issue of immigration now. There is widespread agreement on this stage on the need for immigration reform, a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including dreamers, but there are some areas of disagreement.",July
Dana Bash,"Mayor Buttigieg, you’re in favor of getting rid of the law that makes it a crime to come across the US border illegally. Why won’t that just encourage more illegal immigration?",July
Pete Buttigieg,"When I’m President, illegally crossing the border will still be illegal. We can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law, but we’ve got a crisis on our hands. And it’s not just a crisis of immigration. It’s a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our southern border. It is a stain on the United States of America.",July
Pete Buttigieg,"Americans want comprehensive immigration reform and frankly, we’ve been talking about the same framework for my entire adult lifetime. Protections for dreamers, making sure that that we have a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented, cleaning up lawful immigration. We know what to do. We know the border security can be part of that package and we can still be a nation of laws. The problem is we haven’t had the will to get it done in Washington, and now we have a president who could fix it in a month because there is that bipartisan agreement, but he needs it to be a crisis rather than an achievement. That will end on my wall.",July
Dana Bash,Just a point of clarification. You did raise your hand in the last debate. You do want to do criminalize crossing the border-,July
Pete Buttigieg,"So, in my view, if fraud is involved, then that’s suitable for the criminal statute. If not, then it should be handled under civil law. These show of hands are exactly what is wrong with the way that this race is being-",July
Dana Bash,We’re not going that here.,July
Pete Buttigieg,We appreciate that.,July
Steve Bullock,Thank you. Congressman O’Rourke. You live near the US Mexico border in El Paso. You disagree with Mayor Buttigieg on decriminalizing legal border crossings. Please respond.,July
Beto O’Rourke,"I do. Because in my administration, after we have waived citizenship fees for green card holders, more than 9-million of our fellow Americans freed dreamers from any fear of deportation and stopped criminally prosecuting families and children for seeking asylum and refuge and for-profit detention in this country, and then assist those countries in Central America so that no family ever has to make that 2,000-mile journey. Then I expect that people who come here follow our laws and we reserve the right to criminally prosecute them if they do not.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Congressman. Senator Warren, you say the provision making illegal border crossings a crime is totally unnecessary. Please respond.",July
Elizabeth W.,"So, the problem is that right now, the criminalization statute is what gives Donald Trump the ability to take children away from their parents. It’s what gives him the ability to lock up people at our borders. We need to continue to have border security and we can do that, but what we can’t do is not live our values. I’ve been down to the border. I have seen the mothers. I have seen the cages of babies. We must be a country that everyday lives our values, and that means we cannot make it a crime when someone comes here.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Warren. Just to clarify… Thank you, Senator. Just to clarify, would…",July
Elizabeth W.,… cannot make it a crime when someone comes here.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator. Just to clarify, would you decriminalize-",July
Elizabeth W.,Yes.,July
Dana Bash,… illegal border crossings?,July
Elizabeth W.,The point is not about criminalization. That has given Donald Trump the tool to break families apart.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Elizabeth W.,We need-,July
Dana Bash,"Governor Hickenlooper, your response?",July
John H.,"Well, I agree that we need secure borders. There’s no question about that. And the frustration with what’s going on in Washington is they’re kicking the ball back and forth. Secure the borders. Make sure whatever law we have doesn’t allow children to be snatched from their parents and put in cages. How hard can that be? On the two debate nights, we’ve got 170 years of Washington experience. Somehow it seems like that should be fairly fixable.",July
Elizabeth W.,"Well, and one way to fix it is to decriminalize. That’s the whole point. What we’re looking for here is a way to take away the tools-",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Warren.",July
Elizabeth W.,… that Donald Trump has used to break up families.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Warren. Senator Klobuchar, your response?",July
Amy Klobuchar,"I would say there is the will to change this in Congress. What’s missing is the right person in the White House. I believe that immigrants don’t diminish America, they are America. And if you want to do something about border security, you first of all change the rules so people can seek asylum in those northern triangle countries. Then you pass the bill, and what the bill will do is it’ll greatly reduce the deficit and give us some money for border security and for help processing the cases. And most of all, it will allow for a path to citizenship. Because this is not just about the border.",July
Dana Bash,Thank you.,July
Amy Klobuchar,Donald Trump wants to use these people as political pawns-,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.",July
Amy Klobuchar,… when we have people all over our country that simply want to work and obey the law.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you. Senator Sanders, you want to provide undocumented immigrants free healthcare and free college. Why won’t this drive even more people to come to the U.S. illegally?",July
Bernie Sanders,"Because we’ll have the strong border protections. But the main point I want to make is that what Trump is doing through his racism and his xenophobia is demonizing a group of people. And as president, I will end that demonization. If a mother and a child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path, in my view, they are not criminals. They are people fleeing violence.",July
Bernie Sanders,"And I think the main thing that we’ve got to do, among many others, and Beto made this point, we’ve got to ask ourselves why are people walking 2,000 miles to a strange country where they don’t know the language? So, what we will do the first week we are in the White House is bring the entire hemisphere together, to talk about how we rebuild Hondouras-",July
Dana Bash,Thank you.,July
Bernie Sanders,"… Guatemala, and El Salvador so people do not have to flee their own countries.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator. Governor Bullock, about two-thirds of Democratic voters and many of your rivals here for the nomination support giving health insurance to undocumented immigrants. You haven’t gone that far. Why not?",July
Steve Bullock,"Look, I think this is the part of the discussion that shows how often these debates are detached from peoples’ lives. We got 100,000 people showing up at the border right now. If we decriminalize entry, if we give healthcare to everyone, we’ll have multiples of that. Don’t take my word. That was President Obama’s Homeland Security secretary that said that.",July
Steve Bullock,"The biggest problem right now that we have with immigration is Donald Trump. He’s using immigration to not only rip apart families, but rip apart this country. We can actually get to the point where we have both safe borders, where we have a path to citizenship, where we have opportunities for dreamers. And you don’t have to decriminalize everything. What you have to do is have a president in there with the judgment and the decency to treat someone that comes to the border like one of our own.",July
Elizabeth W.,I’d just like to add on this.,July
Dana Bash,"Senator, he just said your plan is unrealistic. How do you respond?",July
Elizabeth W.,"I think that what we have to do, is we have to be an America that is clear about what we want to do with immigration. We need to expand legal immigration. We need to create a path for citizenship. Not just for dreamers, but for grandmas and for people who have been working here in the farms and for students who have overstayed their visas. We need to fix the prices at the border.",July
Elizabeth W.,"And a big part of how we do that is we do not play into Donald Trump’s hands. He wants to stir up the crisis at the border, because that’s his overall message. It’s, if there’s anything wrong in your life, blame them.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Warren. Governor Bullock, your response?",July
Steve Bullock,"But you are playing into Donald Trump’s hands. The challenge isn’t that it’s a criminal offense to cross the border. The challenge is that Donald Trump is president and using this to rip families apart. A sane immigration system needs a sane leader. And we can do that without decriminalizing and providing healthcare for everyone. And it’s not me saying that. That’s Obama’s Homeland Security secretary that said you’ll cause further problems at the border, not making it better.",July
Elizabeth W.,"What you’re saying is ignore the law. Laws matter. And it matters if we say our law is that we will lock people up who come here seeking refuge, who come here seeking asylum. That is not a crime. And as Americans, what we need to do is have a sane system that keeps us safe at the border, but not criminalize the-",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Warren.",July
Elizabeth W.,… activity of a mother fleeing here for safety.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you. Congressman Ryan, are Senator Sanders’ proposals going to incentivize undocumented immigrants to come into this country illegally?",July
Tim Ryan,"Yes. And right now, if you want to come into the country, you should at least ring the doorbell. We have asylum laws. I saw the kids up in Grand Rapids, not far from here. It is shameful what’s happening, but Donald Trump is doing it. And even if you decriminalize, which we should not do, you still have statutory authority, the president could still use his authority to separate families. So, we’ve got to get rid of Donald Trump, but you don’t decriminalize people just walking into the United States.",July
Tim Ryan,"If they’re seeking asylum, of course, we want to welcome them. We’re a strong enough country to be able to welcome them. And as far as the healthcare goes, undocumented people can buy healthcare, too. I mean, everyone else in America is paying for their healthcare. I don’t think it’s a stretch for us to ask undocumented people in the country to also pay for healthcare.",July
Dana Bash,"Senator Sanders, your response?",July
Bernie Sanders,"Well, two things. A sane immigration policy moves the comprehensive immigration reform. It moves to humane border policy, in which by the way, we have enough administrative judges so that we don’t have incredible backlogs that we have right now.",July
Bernie Sanders,"But to answer your question, I happen to believe that when I talk about healthcare, it is a human right that applies to all people in this country. And under a Medicare for all single-payer system, we could afford to do that.",July
Dana Bash,"Senator Sanders, thank you. Ms. Williamson, your response?",July
Ms. Williamson,"Everything that we’re talking about here tonight is what’s wrong with American politics. And the Democratic Party needs to understand that we should be the party that talks not just about symptoms, but also about causes. When we’re talking about healthcare, we need to talk about more than just the healthcare plan. We need to realize we have a sickness care rather than a healthcare system. We need to be the party talking about why so many of our chemical policies and our food policies and our agricultural policies and our environmental policies and even our economic policies are leading for people getting sick to begin with.",July
Don Lemon,Thank you.,July
Ms. Williamson,That’s what the Democratic… But I want to say more about immigration-,July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Ms. Williamson.",July
Ms. Williamson,Okay.,July
Don Lemon,Thank you Ms. Williamson.,July
Ms. Williamson,I hope you’ll come back to me this time.,July
Don Lemon,"Go ahead. Thank you Ms. Williamson. Let’s turn now to the issue of gun violence. There were three large scale shootings this past weekend in America, at a park in Brooklyn, on the streets of Philadelphia, and one that left three dead and 12 injured at a food festival in Gilroy, California. Mayor Buttigieg, other than offering words of comfort, what are you specifically going to do to stop this epidemic of gun violence?",July
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, this epidemic of gun violence has hit my community, too, far too many times. That’s the worst part of being Mayor, getting the phone call, consoling grieving parents. We have a mass shootings worth of killings everyday in this country.",July
Pete Buttigieg,"What we’re doing hasn’t worked, because we haven’t had a system in Washington capable of delivering what the American people have told us they want. 90% of Republicans want universal background checks, not to mention the common sense solutions like red flag laws that disarm domestic abusers and flag mental health risks. And an end to assault weapons, things like what I carried overseas in uniform, that have no business in American neighborhoods in peacetime, let alone anywhere near a school.",July
Pete Buttigieg,"I was at an event a few days ago, and a 13 year old asked me what we were going to do about school safety, and then began shaking, and then began crying. And we could talk about these policies, but we already know the policies. The only thing I could think of looking into the eyes of this child is, we’re supposed to be dealing with this so you don’t have to. High school is hard enough without having to worry about whether you’re going to get shot.",July
Don Lemon,Thank you.,July
Pete Buttigieg,And when 90% of Americans to happen-,July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Mayor.",July
Pete Buttigieg,… and Washington can’t deliver-,July

Amy Klobuchar,I disagree.,July
Don Lemon,"Governor Hickenlooper, your response, please?",July
Amy Klobuchar,I disagree with his diagnosis of the problem.,July

John H.,"Well, this is the fundamental nonsense of government, another place where despite our best efforts, we can’t seem to make any progress. When I went to the movie theater in Aurora in 2012 and saw that footage of what happened in the crime scene, I’ll never forget it. And we decided that we were going to go out and take on the NRA, and we passed as a purple state. We passed universal background checks. We limited magazine capacity. We did the basic work that for whatever reason, doesn’t seem to be able to get done in Washington.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Governor. Senator Klobuchar, please respond.",July
Amy Klobuchar,"Yes. This isn’t just about a system, or it’s not just about words. This is about the NRA. I sat across from the President of the United States after Parkland, because I’ve been a leader on these issues and have the bill to close the boyfriend loophole. And I watched and wrote down when nine times he said he wanted universal background checks. The next day, he goes and he meets with the NRA and he folds. As your president, I will not fold. I will make sure that we get universal background checks passed, the assault weapon ban, that we do something about magazines, and that we understand when that little six year old boy died, Steven Romero, when his dad said, “He’s only six years old.”",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Amy Klobuchar,All I can say is he’s six years old. We have to remember that.,July
Don Lemon,"Mayor Buttigieg, please respond.",July
Pete Buttigieg,"This is the exact same conversation we’ve been having since I was in high school. I was a junior when the Columbine shooting happened. I was part of the first generation that saw routine school shootings. We have now produced the second school shooting generation in this country. We dare not allow there to be a third. Something is broken. If it is even possible for the same debate around the same solutions that we all know are the right thing to do… They won’t prevent every incident, they won’t save every life, but we know what to do and it has not happened.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Mayor. Senator Klobuchar, please respond.",July
Amy Klobuchar,"Yes. What is broken is a political system that allows the NRA and other large big money to come in and make things not happen, when the majority of people are for. The people are with us now. After Parkland, those students just didn’t march. They talked to their dads and their grandpas and the hunters in their family and they said, “There must be a better way.” Then we elected people in the House of Representatives, and guess what? It changed and they passed universal background checks. And now that bill is sitting on Mitch McConnell’s doorstep because of the money and the power of the NRA. As president I will take them on.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Amy Klobuchar,This is not about systems and words.,July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Governor Bullock, how can Democrats trust you to be the leader on this fight for gun safety when you only changed your position to call for an assault weapons ban last summer?",July
Steve Bullock,"Well, like 40% of American households, I’m a gun owner. I hunt. Like far too many people in America, I’ve been personally impacted by gun violence. I had an 11 year old nephew, Jeremy, shot and killed on a playground. We need to start looking at this as a public health issue, not a political issue.",July
Steve Bullock,"I agree with Senator Klobuchar. It is the NRA. And it’s not just gun violence. It’s when we talk about climate, when we’re talking about prescription drug costs, Washington D.C. is captured by dark money, the Coke Brothers, and others. That’s been the fight of my career. Kicking the Coke Brothers out of Montana, taking the first case after Citizens United up to the Supreme Court, making it so that elections are about people.",July
Steve Bullock,"That’s the way we’re actually going to make a change on this, Don, is by changing that system and most of the things that people are talking about on this stage. We’re not going to address until we kick dark money and the posters of united corporate spending out of these elections.",July
Don Lemon,"Congressman O’Rourke, your response?",July
Beto O’Rourke,"How else can we explain that we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence? A number that no other country comes even close to, that we know what all the solutions are and yet nothing has changed? It is because in this country, money buys influence, access, and increasingly, outcomes.",July
Beto O’Rourke,"The Centers of Disease Control prevented from actually studying the issue in the first place. As president, we will make sure that we ban political action committee contributions to any member of Congress or any candidate for federal office. We will listen to people, not packs. People, not corporations. People, not special interests.",July
Don Lemon,"Congressman, thank you very much. Senator Sanders, you said this in 2013, just months after the Sandy Hook Massacre, and I quote here, “If you pass the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don’t think it will have a profound affect on the tragedies we have seen.” Do you still agree with that statement today?",July
Bernie Sanders,"I think we have got to do… I think what I meant is what President Obama said, and that nobody up here is going to tell you that we have the magical solution to the crisis. Now I come from one of the most rural states in America. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. And as president, I suspect it will be an F record.",July
Bernie Sanders,"What I believe we have got to do is have the guts to finally take on the NRA. You asked me about my record. Back in 1988, coming from a state that had no gun control, I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I lost that election. I will do everything I can, not only to take on the NRA, but to expand in great universal background checks, do away with the strong man provision, do away with the gun show loophole, and do away with the loopholes that now exist for gun manufacturers who are selling large amounts of weapons into communities that are going to gangs.",July
Don Lemon,"Mayor Buttigieg, your response?",July
Pete Buttigieg,"It’s still the conversation that we’ve been having for the last 20 years. Of course we need to get money of out politics, but when I propose the actual structural Democratic reforms that might make a difference, end the Electoral College, amend the Constitution if necessary to clear up Citizens United, have D.C. actually be a state and depoliticize the Supreme Court with structural reform, people look at me funny, as if this country were incapable of structural reform.",July
Pete Buttigieg,Does anybody really think we’re going to overtake Citizens United without Constitutional action? This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldn’t drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that.,July
Don Lemon,"Thank you. Thank you, Mayor.",July
Pete Buttigieg,And you’re telling me we can’t reform our Democracy in our time?,July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Mayor.",July
Pete Buttigieg,We have to or we’ll be having the same argument 20 years from now.,July
Don Lemon,"Please respond, Governor Bullock.",July
Steve Bullock,"You can make changes. Even in Montana with a two-thirds Republican legislature, we passed a law that said, “If you’re going to spend money in our elections, I don’t care if you call yourselves Americans for America, you’re going to have to disclose every one of those dollars in the last 90 days.” I’ll never forget running for reelection in 2016, even we stopped the Coke Brothers from spending it that time. If we can kicked the Coke Brothers out of Montana, we can do it in D.C., we can do it everywhere. And we’re also taking steps, additional steps that we’ve taken… I passed an executive order-",July
Don Lemon,Thank you.,July
Steve Bullock,"Even if you’re in a contract with the state, you have to disclose-",July
Don Lemon,"Governor Bullock, thank you very much.",July
Elizabeth W.,I’d like to have a chance on this.,July
Don Lemon,"Ms. Williamson, how do you respond on this issue of gun safety?",July
Ms. Williamson,"The issue of gun safety, of course, is that the NRA has us in a choke hold. But so do the pharmaceutical companies, so do the health insurance companies, so do the fossil fuel companies, and so do the defense contractors. And none of this will change until we either pass a Constitutional amendment or pass legislation that establishes public funding for federal campaigns.",July
Ms. Williamson,"But for politicians, including my fellow candidates, who themselves have taken tens of thousands, in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars from these same corporate donors, to think that they now have the moral authority to say we’re going to take them on, I don’t think the Democratic Party should be surprised that so many Americans believe yada, yada, yada. It is time for us to start over with people who have not taken donations from any of these corporations and can say with real moral authority, “That is over. We are going to establish public funding for federal campaigns.” That’s what we need to stand up to. We need to have a Constitutional amendment, we need to have legislation to do it.",July
Don Lemon,Thank you.,July
Ms. Williamson,"And until we do it, it’s just the same old.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Ms. Williamson. The debate will be right back right after this short break.",July
Elizabeth W.,I’d like to be heard in this.,July
Jake Tapper,"We are live from Detroit, Michigan. In poll after poll, Democratic voters say that they want a candidate who can beat president Trump more than they want a candidate who agrees with them on major issues. Governor Hickenlooper, you ran a Facebook ad that warned quote, “Socialism is not the answer.” The ad also said quote, “Don’t let extremes give Trump four more years.” Are you saying that Senator Sanders is too extreme to beat president Trump?",July
John H,"I’m saying the policies of this notion that you’re going to take private insurance away from 180 million Americans who, many of them, don’t want to give it. Many of them do want to get rid of it, but some don’t. Many don’t. Or you’re going to the Green New Deal, make sure that every American’s guaranteed a government job that they want. That is a disaster at the ballot box. You might as well FedEx the election of Donald Trump.",July
John H,"I think we’ve got to focus on where Donald Trump is failing. The word malpractice, and this is interesting, I always thought it was doctors or lawyers. It’s negligent, improper, illegal professional activity for doctors, lawyers or public officials. Google it. Check it out. Donald Trump is malpractice personified. We’ve got to point that out. Why is it soybean farmers in Iowa did 10 good years to get back to where they were two years ago? Where’s the small manufacturing jobs that are supposed to come back? Why are we lurching from one international crisis to another? All things that he promised American voters. We’ve got to focus on that and the economy and jobs and training, so that we can promise a future for America that everybody wants to invest in.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you governor. Senator Sanders, you are a proud democratic socialist. How do you respond to Governor Hickenlooper?",July
Bernie Sanders,"Well, the truth is that every credible poll that I have seen has me beating Donald Trump, including the battleground states of Michigan, where I won the Democratic Primary, Wisconsin, where I won the Democratic primary, and Pennsylvania. And the reason we are going to defeat Trump and beat him badly, is that he is a fraud and a phony, and we’re going to expose him for what he is.",July
Bernie Sanders,"The American people want to have a minimum wage, which is a living wage, 15 bucks an hour. I’ve helped lead that effort. The American people want to pay reasonable prices for prescription drugs, not the highest prices in the world. I’ve helped lead the effort for that as well.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you senator. Governor Hickenlooper, I want to bring you back to respond.",July
John H,"So, again, I think if we’re going to force Americans to make these radical changes, they’re not going to go along. Throw your hands up, but you haven’t-",July
Bernie Sanders,Okay.,July
John H,"Oh, I can do it! But you haven’t implemented the plans. Us governors and mayors are the ones that, we have to pick up all the pieces when, suddenly, the government’s supposed to take over all these responsibilities, and there’s no preparation. The details don’t work. You can’t just spring a plan on the world and expect it to succeed.",July
Bernie Sanders,John?,July
Jake Tapper,Senator Sanders.,July
Bernie Sanders,"John, I was a mayor, and I helped transform my city. I have some practical experience. Second of all, interestingly enough, today is the anniversary of Medicare. 54 years ago under Lyndon Johnson and a democratic congress, they started a new program. After one year, it had 19 million elderly people in it. Please don’t tell me that, in a four year period, we cannot go from 65 down to 55 to 45 to 35. This is not radical. This is what virtually every other country on Earth does.",July
Jake Tapper,Thank you senator.,July
Bernie Sanders,We are the odd guy out.,July
Jake Tapper,I want to bring in Congressman Ryan. You’re from the state of Ohio. It’s a state that voted twice for Obama and then went to president Trump in 2016. Please respond to Senator Sanders.,July
Tim Ryan,"I would just say, Hillary Clinton was winning in the polls, too. To take a snapshot in the polls today and apply it 16 months from now, or whenever it is, I don’t think is accurate. Now, in this discussion already tonight, we’ve talked about taking private health insurance away from union members in the Industrial Midwest, we’ve talked about decriminalizing the border and we’ve talked about giving free healthcare to undocumented workers when so many Americans are struggling to pay for their healthcare.",July
Tim Ryan,"I quite frankly don’t think that is an agenda that we can move forward on and win. We’ve got to talk about the working class issues, the people that take a shower after work, who haven’t had a raise in 30 years. If we focus on them, we’ll win the election.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, congressman. I want to bring in Congressman O’Rourke. Your response, sir.",July
Beto O’Rourke,"Bernie was talking about some of the battleground states in which we compete. There’s a new battleground state, Texas, and it has 38 electoral college votes and the way that we put it in play was by going to each one of those 254 counties. No matter how red or rural, we did not write you off. No matter how blue or urban, we did not take you for granted, and we didn’t trim our sales either. We had the courage of our convictions, talking about universal healthcare, comprehensive immigration reform, and confronting the challenge of climate before it is too late. We brought everyone in, and now we have a chance to beat Donald Trump in Texas.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you. Thank you, congressman. I want to bring Governor Bullock. We’re talking about whether Democrats are moving too far to the left to win the White House. President Trump won your home state of Montana by 20 points. How do you respond, sir?",July
Steve Bullock,Yes. The only one of the field of 37 that actually won a Trump state. 25 to 30% of my voters voted for Donald Trump. I know that we do have to win back some of those places we lost and get those Trump voters back if we’re ever going to win. But this isn’t just a choice between the left and the center. It’s not a choice just between sort of these wishlist economics or thinking that we have to sacrifice our values to actually win.,July
Steve Bullock,"What folks want is a fair shot. The way I won, the way we can win, is actually focusing on the economy and democracy not working for most people. That’s how I win. That’s how we can take back the office.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, governor. Senator Warren, you make it a point to say that you’re a capitalist. Is that your way of convincing voters that you might be a safer choice than Senator Sanders?",July
Elizabeth W,"Well, it is my way of talking about I know how to fight and I know how to win. I took on giant banks and I beat them. I took on Wall Street and CEOs, and their lobbyists and their lawyers, and I beat them. I took on a popular Republican incumbent senator and I beat him. I remember when people said Barack Obama couldn’t get elected. Shoot, I remember when people said Donald Trump couldn’t get elected, but here’s where we are. I get it. There is a lot at stake and people are scared, but we can’t choose a candidate we don’t believe in just because we’re too scared to do anything else. And we can’t ask other people to vote for a candidate we don’t believe in. Democrats win when we figure out what is right, and we get out there and fight for it. I am not afraid. And for Democrats to win, you can’t be afraid either.",July
Jake Tapper,"Congressman Delaney, your response.",July
John Delaney,"So, I think Democrats win when we run on real solutions, not impossible promises, when we run on things that are workable, not fairytale economics. Look at this story of Detroit, this amazing city that we’re in. This city is turning around because the government and the private sector or working well together. That has to be our model going forward. We need to encourage collaboration between the government, the private sector and the nonprofit sector, and focus on those kitchen table, pocketbook issues that matter to hardworking Americans, building infrastructure, creating jobs, improving their pay.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, congressmen.",July
John Delaney,Creating universal healthcare and lowering drug prices. We can do it.,July
Jake Tapper,Senator Warren.,July
Elizabeth W,"I don’t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can’t do and shouldn’t fight for. I don’t get it. Our biggest problem in Washington is corruption. It is giant corporations that have taken our government and that are holding it by the throat, and we need to have the courage to fight back against that. And until we’re ready to do that, it’s just more of the same. Well, I’m ready to get in this fight. I’m ready to win this fight.",July
John H,"Thank you, senator. Congressman Delaney.",July
John Delaney,"When we created Social Security, we didn’t say pensions were illegal. We can have big ideas to transform the lives. I mean, I started two companies and took them public before I was 40. I’m as big of a dreamer and an entrepreneur as anyone, but I also believe we need to have solutions that are workable. Can you imagine if we tried to start social security now, but said private pensions are illegal? That’s the equivalent of what Senator Sanders and Senator Warren are proposing with healthcare. That’s not a big idea. That’s an idea that’s dead on arrival. That will never happen. So, why don’t we actually talk about things, big ideas that we can get done. The stakes are too high.",July
John H,"Thank you, congressman. Senator Warren.",July
John Delaney,"So, look, he talks-",July
Bernie Sanders,He just mentioned plans-,July
Jake Tapper,We’ll come to you right after that. Senator Warren.,July
Elizabeth W,"He talks about solutions that are workable. We have tried the solution of Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance, and what have the private insurance companies done? They’ve sucked billions of dollars out of our healthcare system. They’ve made everybody fill out dozens and dozens of forms. Why? Not because they’re trying to track your healthcare. They just want one more excuse to say no. Insurance companies do not have a god given right to suck money out of our health care system, and 2020 is our chance to stop that.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, senator. Senator Sanders.",July
Bernie Sanders,"Detroit was mentioned, and I’m delighted Detroit is rebounding. Let us understand. Detroit was nearly destroyed because of awful trade policy which allowed corporations to throw workers in this community out on the street as they moved to low wage countries. To win this election and to defeat Donald Trump, which by the way, in my view, is not going to be easy, we need to have a campaign of energy and excitement and of vision. We need to bring millions of young people into the political process in a way that we have never seen.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, senator.",July
Bernie Sanders,"By, among other things, making public colleges and universities tuition free and canceling student debt.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, senator. Thank you, senator. I want to bring him senator Klobuchar. At the beginning of the night, you said you’re going to hear a lot of promises on the stage, and previously you have said, when asked about your primary opponents, quote, “A lot of people are making promises and I’m not going to make promises just to get elected.” Who on this stage is making promises just to get elected?",July
Amy Klobuchar,"Everyone wants to get elected, but my point is this. I think when we have a guy in the White House that has now told over 10000 lies, that we better be very straight forward with the American people. And no, do I think that we are going to end up voting for a plan that kicks half of America off of their current insurance in four years? No, I don’t think we’re going to do that. I think there is a better way to get what we all want to see, which is lower costs for healthcare.",July
Amy Klobuchar,"Do I think that we’re going to vote to give free college to the wealthiest kids? No, I don’t think we’re going to do that. So that’s what I’m talking about. But what I don’t like about this argument right now, what I don’t like about it at all, is that we are more worried about winning an argument than winning an election, and I think how we win in an election is to bring everyone with us. And yes, I have one in a state, every single time statewide, I have won those congressional districts that Donald Trump won by over 20 points. He just targeted Minnesota last week, and I’ve done it by getting out there and talking to people, by knowing rural issues and farm issues.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.",July
Amy Klobuchar,And bringing metro people with me in the state that had the highest voter turnout in the country. That’s what we want.,July
Jake Tapper,"I want to bring Congressman O’Rourke. Congressman O’Rourke, please respond.",July
Beto O’Rourke,"I think a big part of leadership and showing our commitment to the American people is delivering on our commitments. As a member of Congress, when I learned that the El Paso VA had the worst wait times for mental health care in the country, meaning that care delayed functionally became care denied, and was related to the suicide epidemic, we made it our priority and we turned around the VA in El Paso. We took that lesson nationally, and I worked with Republican and Democratic colleagues to expand mental health care to veterans, and we got it signed into law by the one person with whom I agree on almost nothing, Donald Trump. To show that, at the end of the day, we will put the American people first before party, before any other concern.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Congressman O’Rourke. We’ve been asking voters to weigh in on what they’d most like to hear Democrats debate. Among the topics they told us they’re most interested in, the climate crisis. Congressman Delaney, I’ll start with you. You say the Green New Deal is about as realistic as Trump saying Mexico was going to pay for the wall. But scientists say we need, essentially, to eliminate fossil fuel pollution by 2050 to avoid the most catastrophic consequences. Why isn’t this sweeping plan to fight the climate crisis…",July
Dana Bash,… why isn’t this sweeping plan to fight the climate crisis realistic?,July
John Delaney,"Well first of all, because it ties its progress to other things that are completely unrelated to climate. Like universal healthcare, guaranteed government jobs and universal basic income. So that only makes it harder to do.",July
John Delaney,"My plan, which gets us to net zero by 2050, which we absolutely have to do for our kids and our grandkids, will get us there. I put a price on carbon, take all the money, give it back to the American people in a dividend. That was introduced by me on a bipartisan basis. It’s the only significant bipartisan climate bill in the Congress. I’m going to increase the Department of Energy research budget by five-fold because we fundamentally have to innovate our way out of this problem. I’m going to create a market for something called direct air capture, which are machines that actually take carbon out of the atmosphere because I don’t think we’ll get to net zero by 2050 unless we have those things. I’m going to increase investment in renewables, and I’m going to create something called the Climate Corp. That is a plan that’s realistic. It’s a bet on the US private innovation economy and creates the incentives to get us to-",July
Dana Bash,Thank you.,July
John Delaney,… net zero by 2050 for our kids.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you. Thank you, Congressman. Senator Warren, you’re a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. Your response to Congressman Delaney?",July
Elizabeth W,"So climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world. It puts every living thing on this planet at risk. I have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best, and that is innovate and create. So I’ve proposed putting $2 trillion in so we do the research. We then say anyone in the world can use it so long as you build it right here in America. That will produce about 1.2 million manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan, right here in Ohio, right here in the industrial Midwest.",July
Elizabeth W,"And the second thing we will do is we will then sell those products all around the world. Right now, for every $1, the United States-",July

Elizabeth W,… spends trying to market around the world-,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Warren.",July
Elizabeth W,… China’s spending $100.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Warren. Governor Hickenlooper, you take issue with the Green New Deal. Please respond.",July
John H,"Well, I think the guarantee for a public job, for everyone who wants one, is a classic part of the problem. It’s a distraction. I share the urgency of every one up here. We have to recognize, I mean, everyone’s got good ideas. What we do in this country is no better than just a best practice, right? It’s what we do here is a best practice at a template, but it’s got to be done all over the world. So we’ve got to be building bridges right now with people like China who were cheating on international agreements and stealing intellectual property. We need to work on that, but not with the tariff system. We need every country working together if we’re going to really deal with climate change in a realistic way.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you. Senator Warren, your response?",July
Elizabeth W,"Look, I put a real policy on the table. To create 1.2 million new jobs in green manufacturing. There’s going to be up $23 trillion worldwide market for this. This could revitalize huge cities across this country, and no one wants to talk about. What you want to do instead is find the Republican talking point of a made-up piece of some other part and say, “Oh, we don’t really have to do anything.” That’s the problem we’ve got in Washington right now. It continues-",July
Dana Bash,Thank you.,July
Elizabeth W,"… to be a Washington that works great for oil companies, just not for people worried about climate change.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Warren. Congressman Ryan?",July
Tim Ryan,Yeah.,July
Dana Bash,"We are here in Michigan where there are about 180,000 workers in auto manufacturing. Your state of Ohio has around 96,000 workers in that industry. Senator Sanders is co-sponsoring a bill that would eliminate new gas power car sales by 2040. Given the number of auto manufacturing workers in your state, how concerned are you about Senator Sanders’ plan?",July
Tim Ryan,"Well, if we get our act together, we won’t have to worry about it. My plan is to create a chief manufacturing officer so we could actually start making things in the United States again, that would pull the government, the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, work with the private sector, work with investors, emerging tech companies to dominate the electric vehicle market. China dominates it now 50 to 60%. I want us to dominate the battery market and make those here in the United States and cut the workers in on the deal. The charging stations, solar panels, same thing. China dominates 60% of the solar panel market.",July
Tim Ryan,"So this person will work in the White House, report directly to me, and we’re going to start making things again. But you cannot get there on climate unless we talk about agriculture. We need to convert our industrial agriculture system, over to a sustainable and regenerative agriculture system-",July
Female,I agree.,July
Tim Ryan,"… that actually sequesters carbon into the soil. And you can go ask Gabe Brown and Allen Williams who actually make money off of regenerative agriculture, so we can move away from all the subsidies that we’re giving to farmers. They haven’t made a profit in five years, and we could start getting good food into our schools and into our communities. That’s going to drive healthcare down. That’s another part of the healthcare conversation-",July
Dana Bash,Thank you.,July
Tim Ryan,… that we didn’t even have. How do we start-,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Congressman Ryan.",July
Tim Ryan,… talking about health instead of just disease care?,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you. Senator Sanders, your response?",July
Bernie Sanders,"I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas. Republicans are not afraid of big ideas. They could give $1 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires and profitable corporations. They could bail out the crooks on Wall Street. So please don’t tell me that we cannot take on the fossil fuel industry, and nothing happens unless we do that.",July
Bernie Sanders,"Here is the bottom line. We got to ask ourselves a simple question. What do you do with an industry that knowingly, for billions of dollars in short-term profits, is destroying this planet? I say that it’s criminal activity-",July
Dana Bash,Thank you.,July
Bernie Sanders,… that cannot be allowed to continue.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. Congressman, your response?",July
Tim Ryan,"Well, yeah, I would just say … I didn’t say we couldn’t get there until 2040, Bernie. You don’t have to yell. I mean, all I’m saying is, all I’m saying is we have to invent our way out of this thing, and if we’re waiting for 2040 for a ban to come in on gasoline vehicles, we’re screwed. So we better get busy now, and that’s why I’m saying get a chief manufacturing officer, align the environmental incentives with the financial incentives and make sure that people can actually make money off of the new technologies that are moving forward. And then here’s what I’ll do as President.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Congressman.",July
Tim Ryan,"Cut the worker in on the deal. Make sure these are union jobs, and I will double union membership to make sure that these new jobs pay what the old fossil fuel jobs pay.",July
Dana Bash,"Senator Sanders, your response?",July
Bernie Sanders,"Look, on this issue, my friends, there is no choice. We have got to be super aggressive, if we love our children and if we want to leave them a planet that is healthy and is habitable. So I don’t disagree with Tim. What that means is we got to A, take on the fossil fuel industry. B, it means we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and a hell of a lot of good union jobs as we do that. We’ve got to transform our transportation system-",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Bernie Sanders,And we have to lead the world-,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Sanders.",July
Bernie Sanders,… because this is not just an American issue.,July
Dana Bash,"Governor Bullock, your response?",July
Steve Bullock,"All of us agree that we have to address climate change. No one on this stage is talking about though, the Republicans won’t even acknowledge that climate change is real, Dana. And that’s because of the corrupting influence of money. That has been the fight of my career.",July
Steve Bullock,"And second of which, as we transition to this clean energy economy, you’ve got to recognize there are folks that have spent their whole life powering our country, and far too often, Democrats sound like they’re part of the problem. We got to make sure to aid in those transitions as we get to a carbon neutral world, which I think we can do by 2040.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Governor. Just to clarify, who is part of the problem?",July
Steve Bullock,"Who? Oh no. I think Democrats, often when they’re saying, “Oh, these fossil fuel industries, these workers, those coal miner workers.” Look, the world’s changing. We got to make it change. But I think Democrats often sound like the people that, as Congressman Ryan would say, shower at the end of the day, that they’re part of the problem. And far too many communities are being left behind as we make this transition.",July
Dana Bash,Thank you.,July
Steve Bullock,"Look, we’re having this discussion, and we can talk about competing plans-",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Governor. I want to get Senator Sanders a chance to respond.",July
Bernie Sanders,"Look, Steve, ain’t nobody in the Congress who’s more strongly pro worker than I am. So when I talk about taking on the fossil fuel industry, what I am also talking about is a just transition. All right? We can create, and what the Green New Deal is about, it’s a bold idea. We can create millions of good paying jobs. We can rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated. So we are not anti-worker. We are going to provide, make sure that those workers have a transition. New jobs, healthcare and education.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Steve Bullock,And look-,July
Dana Bash,"Governor Bullock, your response?",July
Steve Bullock,"And look, Bernie. I was a union-side labor lawyer. I fought day after day, and I know, but we set this up as a false choice far too often. Are we going to actually address climate change? Fire seasons are 80 days longer in the west now. Or are we going to give people a better shot at a better life? You can do both.",July
Bernie Sanders,Yes.,July
Steve Bullock,"But let’s actually have the scientists drive this. Let’s not just talk about plans that are written for press releases that will go nowhere else, if we can’t even get a Republican-",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Governor Bullock.",July
Steve Bullock,… to acknowledge that the climate’s changing.,July
Dana Bash,"Congressman O’Rourke, your response?",July
Beto O’Rourke,"I’ve listened to scientists on this, and they’re very clear. We don’t have more than 10 years to get this right, and we won’t meet that challenge with half steps or half measures or only half the country. We’ve got to bring everyone in. The people of Detroit and those that I listened to in Flint last week, they want the challenge, they want those jobs, they want to create the future for this country and the world. Those community college students that I met in Tucumcari, New Mexico understand that wind and solar jobs are the fastest growing jobs in the country, and those farmers in Iowa say, “Pay me for the environmental services, the planting cover crops and keeping more land in conservation easements.” That’s how we meet the challenge. We do it with everyone in this country. We bring everyone into the solution.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Congressman. Mayor Buttigieg, your response?",July
Pete Buttigieg,"We have all put out highly similar visions on climate. It is all theoretical. We will deal with climate if and only if we win the presidency, if and only if we beat Donald Trump. Nominate me and you get to see the President of the United States stand next to an American war veteran and explain why he chose to pretend to be disabled when it was his chance to serve. Nominate me and we will have a different conversation with American voters about why the President of the United States thinks you’re a sucker. When the problem in your life is your paycheck is not going up nearly as fast as the cost of housing or the cost of education-",July

Pete Buttigieg,… or the cost of prescription drugs. And he has done nothing about it except a tax cut for the corporations.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Senator Klobuchar, I want to ask you about something that CNN heard from a Michigan Democratic primary voter. We’ve been reaching out and getting their questions. Kimber from Birmingham, Michigan has this question. What is your plan to address infrastructure including the water issue so another Flint, Michigan does not happen again?",July
Amy Klobuchar,"Thank you, Dana. And I was just in Flint, and they are still drinking bottled water in that town, and that is outrageous. So my plan, and I am the first one that came out with an infrastructure plan, and I did that because this is a bread and butter issue. It’s a bread and butter issue for people that are caught in traffic jams. I think the governor here in Michigan smartly ran on the slogan, “Fix the damn roads.” And it is an issue for union jobs.",July
Amy Klobuchar,"And so I think what we need to do is not have a president that’s promised he was going to do that on election night, if anyone remembers, and then he hasn’t followed through. He has done nothing. He blew up a meeting at the White House.",July
Amy Klobuchar,"I would put $1 trillion into this, and I would pay for it by, first of all, changing the capital gains rate, by doing something when it comes to that regressive tax bill that left everyone behind but really made his Mar-a-Lago friends richer, as he promised. And I would take that money and put it into rural broadband and green infrastructure so you won’t have what you just saw in Detroit with the Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood, the African neighborhood that was African-American neighborhood that was most hit when you had those recent rainstorms.",July

Amy Klobuchar,That you need a voice from the heartland.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Ms. Williamson, what’s your response on the Flint water crisis?",July
Ms. Williamson,"My response on the Flint water crisis is that Flint is just the tip of the iceberg. I was recently in Denmark, South Carolina where it is… There is a lot of talk about it being the next Flint. We have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act. We have communities, particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities, all over this country who are suffering from environmental injustice. I assure you, I lived in Grosse Pointe. What happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe. This is part of the dark underbelly of American society. The racism, the bigotry, and the entire conversation that we’re having here tonight. If you think any of this wonkiness is is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I’m afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days. We need to say it like it is. It’s bigger than Flint. It’s all over this country. It’s particularly people of color. It’s particularly people who do not have the money to fight back. And if the Democrats don’t start saying it then why would those people feel that they’re there for us? And if those people don’t feel it they won’t vote for us and Donald Trump will win.",July
Don Lemon,Thank you very much Ms. Williamson.,July
Ms. Williamson,Thank you.,July
Don Lemon,"We want to turn now to the issue of race in America. Congressman O’Rourke, President Trump is pursuing a re-election strategy based, in part, on racial division. How do you convince primary voters that you’d be the best nominee to take on President Trump and heal the racial divide in America?",July
Beto O’Rourke,"We’ll call his racism out for what it is. And also talk about its consequences. It doesn’t just offend our sensibilities to hear him say, “Send her back.” About a member of Congress because she’s a woman of color, because she’s a Muslim American. It doesn’t just offend our sensibilities when he calls Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals or seeks to ban all Muslims from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over, from every tradition of faith. It is also changing this country. Hate crimes are on the rise every single one of the last three years. On the day that he signed his executive order attempting to ban Muslim travel, the mosque in Victoria, Texas was burned to the ground. So we must not only stand up against Donald Trump and defeat him in this next election. But we must also ensure that we don’t just tolerate or respect our differences, but we embrace them. That’s what we’ve learned in El Paso, Texas, my hometown, one of the safest cities in the United States of America. Not despite, but because it’s a city of immigrants and asylum seekers and refugees. We will show that our diversity-",July

Beto O’Rourke,"… Is our strength, in my administration.",July
Don Lemon,"Congressman O’Rourke, thank you very much. Governor Hickenlooper, why are you the best nominee to heal the racial divide in America? Please respond.",July
John H,"Well, the core value behind this entire country’s history is working towards a more perfect union, that all people are created equal. And we fall and fall away from that. I think the job is incumbent on any one of us to make the convincing case that we can deliver an urban agenda that represents progress in schools. In Colorado, when I was mayor, we got to universal pre-K for every kid in the urban city. We did major police reform, 10 years before Ferguson. Why is it now that five years after Ferguson we still don’t have anything? How do we get affordable housing? We created a scholarship fund for every kid. You’ve got to deliver a vision like that for the whole country.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, governor.",July
Elizabeth W,Wait.,July
Don Lemon,"Senator Warren, I’m coming to you now. Last week the FBI Director, Christopher Wray, said that the majority of domestic terrorism cases this year had been motivated by white supremacy. In fact, the alleged shooter in this weekend’s attack in Gilroy, California referenced a well-known white supremacist book on social media. How are you going to combat the rise of white supremacy?",July
Elizabeth W,"We need to call out white supremacy for what it is, domestic terrorism. And it poses a threat to the United States of America. We live in a country now where the president is advancing environmental racism, economic racism, criminal justice racism, health care racism. The way we do better is to fight back and show something better. So I have a plan, for example, on education that says we have to build a better education system for all our kids. But we’ve got to acknowledge what’s happened on race. So my plan has universal tuition-free college for all of our kids, but also increases the Pell grants and levels the playing field by putting $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities. It cancels student loan debt for 95% of the kids with student loan debt and helps close the black-white wealth gap in America.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you senator, very much. Mayor Buttigieg, you have been criticized for your handling of racial issues in your home city of South Bend, from diversity in the police force to housing policy. Given your record, how can you convince African-Americans that you should be the Democratic nominee?",July
Mayor Buttigieg,"As an urban mayor serving a diverse community, the racial divide lives within me. I’m not saying that I became mayor and racism or crime or poverty ended on my watch. But in our city we have come together repeatedly to tackle challenges like the fact that far too many people were not getting the help they needed in their housing, and so we directed it to a historically under-invested African-American neighborhood. Right now, in the wake of a police-involved shooting, our community is moving from hurting to healing by making sure that the community can participate in things like revising the use-of-force policy and making sure there are community voices on the board of safety that handles police matters. I proposed a Douglass plan to tackle this issue nationally, because mayors have hit the limits of what you can do unless there is national action. Systemic racism has touched every part of American life, from housing to health to home ownership. If you walk into an emergency room and you are black, your reports of pain will be taken less seriously. If you apply for a job and you are black, you are less likely to be called just because of the name on the resume. It’s why I’ve proposed that we do everything from investing in historically-redlined neighborhoods-",July

Don Lemon,"Thank you, mayor.",July
Mayor Buttigieg,To supporting entrepreneurship for black Americans.,July
Don Lemon,"Thank you very much. Senator Klobuchar, what do you say to those Trump voters who prioritize the economy over the president’s bigotry?",July
Amy Klobuchar,"Well, first of all, there are people that voted for Donald Trump before that aren’t racist, they just wanted a better shake in the economy. And so I would appeal to them. But I don’t think anyone can justify what this president is doing. Little kids literally woke up this weekend, turned on the TV, and saw their president calling their city, the town of Baltimore, nothing more than a home for rats. And I can tell you, as your president, that will stop. The second thing I would say is that economic opportunity means economic opportunity for everyone in this country. I know that because I have lived it. And that means when we put out there better childcare and better education and we pay teachers more and we make sure there’s a decent retirement system in place. Yes, we help the African-American community, and we must, because they have been the ones that have been most hurt by what we’ve seen in the last decades. But we help everyone. So what I say to the people in my rural parts of my state, just like I say to them in the city and bring them together, is that economic opportunity must be there for everyone.",July
Ms. Williamson,"Senator Klobuchar, thank you very much. Congressman O’Rourke, please respond.",July
Beto O’Rourke,"I want to acknowledge something that we’re all touching on, which is the very foundation of this country. The wealth that we have built, the way we became the greatest country on the face of the planet, was literally on the backs of those who were kidnapped and brought here by force. The legacy of slavery and segregation and Jim Crow and suppression is alive and well in every aspect of the economy and in the country today. As president, I will sign into law and new Voting Rights Act. I will focus on education, address healthcare disparities. But I will also sign into law Sheila Jackson Lee’s reparations bill so that we can have the national conversation we’ve waited too long in this country to have.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Congressman O’Rourke. Speaking of reparations, Ms. Williamson, many of your opponents support a commission to study the issue of reparations for slavery. But you are calling for up to 500 billion dollars in financial assistance. What makes you qualified to determine how much is owed in reparations?",July
Ms. Williamson,"Well, first of all, it’s not 500 billion dollars in financial assistance. It’s 500 billion dollar, 200 to 500 billion dollars, payment of a debt that is owed. That is what reparations is. We need some deep truth-telling when it comes. We don’t need another commission to look at evidence. I appreciate what Congressman O’Rourke has said. It is time for us to simply realize that this country will not heal. All that a country is as a collection of people. People heal when there is some deep truth-telling. We need to recognize that, when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in America, it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with. That great injustice has had to do with the fact that there was 250 years of slavery followed by another 100 years of domestic terrorism.",July
Ms. Williamson,"What makes me qualified to say 200 to 500 billion dollars? I’ll tell you what makes me qualified. If you did the math of the 40 acres and a mule, given that there was four to five million slaves at the end of the civil war, four to five, and they were all promised 40 acres and a mule for every family of four. If you did the math today, it would be trillions of dollars. And I believe that anything less than a hundred billion dollars is an insult. And I believe that 200 to 500 billion is politically feasible today, because so many Americans realize there is an injustice that continues to form a toxicity underneath the surface and emotional turbulence that only reparations will heal.",July
Don Lemon,"Ms. Williamson, thank you very much. Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders, you don’t think cash payments are the best way to address this issue. But, according to a new Gallup poll, 73% of African-Americans are in favor of cash payments to black Americans who are descendants of slaves. How do you respond to them?",July
Bernie Sanders,"Well, I respond to that by saying that I am supportive of Jim Clyburn’s legislation, which is called 10-20-30. And what that understands is that, as a result of slavery and segregation and the institutional racism we see now in healthcare, in education, in financial services, we are going to have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in America, including African-American communities. In terms of education, I also have a plan. It’s called the Thurgood Marshall Plan, and it would focus on ending the growth of segregated schools in America. It would triple funding for Title I schools. It would make sure that teachers in this country earned at least $60,000 a year.",July

Don Lemon,"Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Detroit. Let’s turn now to the economy. Congressman Ryan, President Trump’s tariffs have boosted the US steel industry, but hurt auto manufacturers like those here in Michigan, which could drive up the cost of cars. As president, would you continue President Trump’s steel tariffs?",July

They subsidize goods coming into this country. They’ve displaced steel workers, auto workers across the board, eroded our manufacturing.",July

But you know how you beat China? You out-compete them. And that’s why I’d put a chief manufacturing officer in place to make sure that we rebuild the manufacturing base. We’ve got to fill these factories in Detroit, in Youngstown, that used to make cars and steel. We’ve got to fill them with workers who are making electric vehicles, batteries, charging stations, make sure they’re making solar panels.",July

He has a tactical move. What’s the grand strategy for the United States? China has a 100-year plan, a 50-year plan, a 30-year plan, a 20-year plan. We live in a 24-hour news cycle. That spells disaster for our economy, and disaster for our global politics.",July

John Hickenloop,"So I think, again, I think Congressman Delaney has got a point here, and there is a way of looking at trade that is therapeutic. The bottom line is you talk to any economist, there is not a single example in history where a trade war had a winner. Trade wars are for losers, and the bottom line is we’ve got to recognize, let’s negotiate a better trade deal, but you’re not going to win against China in a trade war when they’ve got 25% of our total debt.",July

Here’s Trump, gives that giant tax cut, and at the same time so we’re paying in tariffs about, oh, $800-1,200 per household, and then we give this incredible tax cut to the rich.

Dana Bash,… you are proposing to make college free for all qualified students. Should the government pay for children from wealthier families to go to college?,July
Ms. Williamson,I think that all domestic and international policies should be based on the idea that anything we do to help people thrive is a stimulation to our economy. That’s how you stimulate your economy. So if a few people take advantage but there are four or five people who are going to take the money that they then have in the bank…,July
Ms. Williamson,"When you look at this $1.5 trillion college debt, this is why I agree with Bernie or I would be the, okay, why don’t we swap it? We had a $2 trillion tax cut where 83 cents of every dollar goes to the very, very richest among us. That does not stimulate the economy.",July
Ms. Williamson,"If we get rid of this college debt, think of all the young people who will have the discretionary spending, they’ll be able to start their business. The best thing you could do to stimulate the US economy is to get rid of this debt. This is not just about a plan to do it; it’s about a philosophy of governing.",July
Ms. Williamson,"And I’ve heard some people hear tonight, I almost wonder why you’re Democrats. You seem to think there’s something wrong about using the instruments of government to help people. That is what government should do. All policy should help people thrive. That is how we will have peace and that is how we will help .",July

I don’t think that makes sense, and I am very concerned if we do things like that, the debt we’re going to pass on to the next generation and the next generation.",July

If voters are hearing the same message from you and President Trump on the issue of military intervention, how should they expect that you will be any different from him?",July
Bernie Sanders,"Trump is a pathological liar. I tell the truth. We have been in Afghanistan I think 18 years, in Iraq 16 or 17 years. We have spent $5 trillion on the war on terror, and there are probably more terrorists out there now than before it began.",July
Bernie Sanders,"We’re going to spend… The Congress passed, and I will not vote for, a $715 billion military budget more than the 10 next countries combined. What we need is a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy, ending conflicts by people sitting at a table, not by killing each other. As president of the United States, I will go to the United Nations and not denigrate it, not attack the UN, but bring countries together in the Middle East and all over the world to come to terms with their differences and solve those problems peacefully.

So I went and sent them off in their deployments. Big, noisy hangers. But I also mourned with their families when they didn’t come back.",July
John Hickenloop,"We are able now to, I call it constant engagement, but we should have an international diplomatic approach where we’re talking to everybody.

I want to go to Congressman Ryan, and I want to turn to the subject of North Korea, which just hours ago launched two short-range ballistic missiles for the second time in less than a week. Congressman, you’ve said that you would not meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un unless you were at least close to a deal. Now, Senator Klobuchar says that she would “always be willing to meet with leaders to discuss policies.” Is that view wrong?",July
Tim Ryan,"Yeah, I think so. I love Amy Klobuchar, but I think she’s wrong on this one. I don’t think presidents of the United States meet with dictators. We saw what just happened with President Trump. He goes to the demilitarized zone with the leader of North Korea, gives him a huge photo op, gives him global credibility because the most powerful person in the world is sitting there and meeting with him, and weeks later he’s lobbing more missiles.",July
Tim Ryan,"That doesn’t make any sense. We’ve got to demilitarize our foreign policy. We’ve got to make sure that we are engaging these countries all the time. This is very difficult work. I’ve been in Congress 17 years. I sit on a Defense Appropriations Committee. I sat on the Armed Services Committee. This is long, tedious work, much of it done outside of the eye of the TV camera. And as president, you’ve got to monitor that and be very disciplined every day. Don’t go give a dictator a huge win. Sit down and do your job.",July

He’s taken us out of the climate change agreement, out of the Iran nuclear agreement, out of the Russian nuclear agreement, and I don’t agree with that.",July
Amy Klobuchar,"And when he was just with Vladimir Putin at the G20, when he was asked about invading our democracy, he made a joke. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their lives on the battlefield to protect our democracy and our right to vote.",July
Jake Tapper,Thank you.,July
Amy Klobuchar,"Four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama lost their life in a church at the heights-",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Amy Klobuchar,"… of the civil rights amendment. So I do believe you meet with people, but you better have an agenda.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Amy Klobuchar,And you better put our interests of our country first. Not the Russians’.,July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Mayor Buttigieg, you served in Afghanistan, where just yesterday two US service members were killed. There are currently about 14,000 US service members in Afghanistan. You’ve said, “One thing everybody can agree on is that we’re getting out of Afghanistan.” Will you withdraw all US service members by the end of your first year in office?",July
Pete Buttigieg,We will withdraw. We have to.,July
Jake Tapper,In your first year?,July
Pete Buttigieg,"Yes. Look, around the world we will do whatever it takes to keep America safe, but I thought I was one of the last troops leaving Afghanistan when I thought I was turning out the lights years ago.",July
Pete Buttigieg,"Every time I see news about somebody being killed in Afghanistan, I think about what it was like to hear an explosion over there and wonder whether it was somebody that I served with, somebody that I knew, a friend, roommate, colleague.",July
Pete Buttigieg,"We’re pretty close to the day when we will wake up to the news of a casualty in Afghanistan who was not born on 9/11. I was sent into that war by a congressional authorization as well as the president, and we need to talk not only about the need for a president committed to ending endless war, but the fact that Congress has been asleep at the switch.",July
Pete Buttigieg,"And on my watch, I will propose that any authorization for the use of military force have a three-year sunset and have to be renewed because if men and women in the military have the courage to go serve, members of Congress ought to have to summon-",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Mayor.",July
Pete Buttigieg,… the courage to vote on whether they ought to .,July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Mayor. I want to bring in Congressmen O’Rourke. Congressmen O’Rourke, responding, returning rather to the question of whether you would withdraw all US service members from Afghanistan during your first year in office as president, how do you respond, sir?",July
Beto O’Rourke,"I would in my first term in office. Agree that there is nothing about perpetuating this war already in its 18th year that will make it any better. We’ve satisfied the reasons for our involvement in Afghanistan in the first place, and it’s time to bring those service members back home from Afghanistan, but also from Iraq, also from Yemen and Somalia and Libya and Syria.",July
Beto O’Rourke,"There is no reason for us to be at war all over the world tonight. As president, I will end those wars and we will not start new wars. We will not send more US service members overseas to sacrifice their lives and to take the lives of others in our name. We can resolve-",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Congressman.",July
Beto O’Rourke,… these challenges peacefully and diplomatically.,July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Congressman. Governor Hickenlooper, you disagree. You’ve said that you’re open to keeping some service members in Afghanistan beyond your first term.",July
John Hickenloop,I look at it as a-,July
Jake Tapper,Please respond.,July
John Hickenloop,"… humanitarian issue, and with all due respect, you’re looking at the condition of women. If we completely-",July
Ms. Williamson,Thank you.,July
John Hickenloop,"… pull our troops out of there, you’re going to see a humanitarian disaster that will startle and frighten every man, woman, and child in this country.",July
John Hickenloop,"I mean, we have troops in over 400 different locations around the world. Most of them are small, they’re peacekeeping. They’re not greatly at risk. We’re going to have to be in Afghanistan. Look at the progress that’s happened in that country. We’re going to turn our backs and walk away from people that have risked their lives to help them build a different future for Afghanistan and that part of the world?",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor. Senator Warren, you want to make it US policy that the US will never use a nuclear weapon unless another country uses one first. Now, President Obama reportedly considered that policy, but ultimately decided against it. Why should the US tie its own hands with that policy?",July
Elizabeth W,"Because it makes the world safer. The United States is not going to use nuclear weapons preemptively, and we need to say so to the entire world. It reduces the likelihood that someone miscalculate, someone misunderstands.",July
Elizabeth W,"Our first responsibility is to keep ourselves safe, and what’s happening right now with Donald Trump as they keep expanding the different ways that we have nuclear weapons, the different ways that they can be used, puts us all at risk.",July
Elizabeth W,"You know, we talk about what’s happening around the world. I have three older brothers who served in the military. I see that they would do anything. Our military is the best on earth, but we should not be asking our military to take on jobs that do not have a military solution. We need to use our diplomatic tools, our economic tools, and if we’re going to send someone into war, we better have a plan for how we’re going to get them out on the other end.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator. Governor Bullock, your response to Senator Warren’s proposal to the US never use a nuclear weapon first?",July
Steve Bullock,"I wouldn’t want to take that off the table. I think America’s strength, we have to be able to say that.",July
Steve Bullock,"Look, never, I hope certainly in my term or anyone else, would we really even get close to pulling that trigger, but by the same token, America’s strength… And look, this president’s made American first is America alone. Our allies no longer trust us. Our adversaries are with us. But going from a position of strength, we should be negotiating down so there aren’t nuclear weapons, but drawing those lines in sand at this point I wouldn’t do.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Governor. Senator Warren, your response.",July
Elizabeth W,"We don’t expand trust around the world by saying, “No, we might be the first ones to use a nuclear weapon.” That puts the entire world at risk and puts us at risk right in the middle of this. At a time when Donald Trump is pulling out of our nuclear negotiations, expanding the opportunities for nuclear proliferation around the world, has pulled us out of the deal in Iran, and Iran is now working on its nuclear weapon, the world gets closer and closer to nuclear warfare.",July
Don Lemon,", Senator.",July
Elizabeth W,We have to have an-,July
Don Lemon,Senator.,July
Elizabeth W,… announced policy that is one the entire world can live with. We need to make that clear. We will respond-,July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Senator Warren.",July
Elizabeth W,"… if someone else does, but not first.",July
Don Lemon,"Governor Bullock, please respond.",July
Steve Bullock,"Part I agree with, but by the , like we need to get back to nuclear proliferation.",July
Elizabeth W,What?,July
Steve Bullock,"But when you have folks… Deproliferation, reducing that. But at the same time, when you actually have Korea, when you have others, I don’t want to turn around and say, “Well, Detroit has to be gone before we would ever use that” when so many crazy folks are getting closer to having nuclear weapon. I don’t want them to think, “I could strike this country” and I and we as the United States of America wouldn’t do a thing. Part of the strength really is the ability to deter.",July
Don Lemon,"Governor Bullock. . Governor, thank you very much. Moving on now.",July
Bernie Sanders,Could I add something to that discussion?,July
Don Lemon,"Moving on now. Please, Senator. Senator, please. Moving on now. As you know, to serve as president of the United States, all of you know this, you have to be at least 35 years old. So Mayor Buttigieg, you just qualified. You’re 37, the youngest candidate in this field. Standing next to you is the oldest candidate, Bernie Sanders, at age 77. Should voters take into consideration age when choosing a presidential candidate?",July
Pete Buttigieg,I don’t care how old you are. I care about your vision. But I do think it matters that we have a new generation of leaders stepping up around the world. Leaders like the… I actually think it’s good that the prime minister of New Zealand has gotten a lot of attention in Democratic debates. She’s masterful. She is younger than I would be when I take office.,July
Pete Buttigieg,"This is the kind of trend America might be leading instead of following, but only if it’s actually backed by the right vision. And we can have great presidents at any age. What I will say is we need the kind of vision that’s going to win. We cannot have a vision that amounts to back to normal. Because the only reason we got this president is that normal didn’t work. We have to be ready to take on this president.",July
Pete Buttigieg,"And by the way, something that hasn’t been talked about as much tonight, take on his enablers in Congress. You know, when David Duke… When David Duke ran for Congress, ran for governor, the Republican Party 20 years ago ran away from him. Today, they are supporting naked racism in the White House who were at best silent about it.",July
Pete Buttigieg,"And if you were watching this at home and you are a Republican member of Congress, consider the fact that when the sun sets on your career and they are writing your story of all the good and bad things you did in your life, the thing you will be remembered for is whether in this moment with this president, you found the courage to stand up to him or you continue to put party over country.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Mayor. Senator Sanders, as the senior statesman of the group, please respond to Mayor Buttigieg.",July
Bernie Sanders,"Well, Pete is right. It’s a question of vision, that’s what it is. Whether you’re young, whether you’re old, whether you’re in between. And my vision among other things says that if we’re going to fight for healthcare, we don’t take money from the drug companies or the insurance companies. And I have asked all of the candidates who are running to say they will not accept money from those entities who in my view are going to war against the American people in terms of healthcare. That’s a new vision.",July
Bernie Sanders,"A new vision says that we must cancel completely student debt because the younger generation in this country today, for the first time in modern American history, will have a lower standard of living than their parents.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. The debate continues right after this. . Please.",July
Jake Tapper,"We have covered a lot of ground tonight. Now it is time for closing statements. You will each receive one minute. Governor Bullock, we’re going to begin with you.",July
Steve Bullock,"Thanks Jake. I was raised in a single parent household, at times paycheck to paycheck. Only knew there was a governor’s house in town because I delivered newspapers to it. So, I’ve made it about four blocks in life. Worked my way through college. Paid my way through law school. I had a chance to actually go from delivering newspapers to the governor’s house as a kid to now raising our three kids in it.",July
Steve Bullock,"We’ve got to recognize for far too many people in America, that shot no longer exists. For far too many in this country, it never has. I’m running for president to beat Donald Trump, win back the places we lost and make sure that Americans know that where Washington’s left them behind in their economy and their political system, I’ll be there.",July
Steve Bullock,This isn’t a choice just between center and left. We don’t have to choose between what we don’t want and what we can’t afford. Folks want a different way. They want to believe the economy and our democracy can work for us. That’s why I’m running for president.,July
Jake Tapper,Thank you. Miss Williamson.,July
Ms. Williamson,"Yes. Our problem is not just that we need to defeat Donald Trump. We need a plan to solve institutionalized hatred, collectivized hatred and White nationalism. In order to do that, we need more than political insight, or game, and wonkiness, and intellectual argument. Those things will not defeat Donald Trump.",July
Ms. Williamson,"We need some radical truth telling, not just to talk about healthcare but talk about why we’re so sick all the time. We need to have a serious conversation about race and what is truly owed. Even on the subject of foreign policy, it’s all about symptoms and not about cars. We need to talk about the fact that the United States has sacrificed our moral leadership, the fact that countries see us not only domestically but internationally with policies that simply support our corporate overlords.",July
Ms. Williamson,"The fact that our national defense agenda is driven more by short-term profits for defense contractors than by genuine peace building. There’s some corruption that’s so deep, ladies and gentleman. Until the Democratic Party is ready to speak to deeper corruption knowing that we ourselves sometimes because of our own corporate donations have participated, then I’m afraid those who vote for Trump will continue to vote for Trump and those who might not like Donald Trump will continue to stay home.",July
Ms. Williamson,"I want a politics that goes much deeper. I want a politics that speaks to the heart, because the only way to fight … you keep talking about how we’re going to fight Donald Trump. You can’t fight dog whistles, you have to override them. The only way you can override them is with new voices, voices of energy that only come from the fact that America has been willing to live up to our own mistakes, atone for our own mistakes, make amends for our own mistakes, love each other, love our democracy, love future generations, something emotional and psychological that will not be emerging from anything on this stage. It will emerge from something I’m the one who’s qualified to bring forth.",July
Jake Tapper,Congressman Delaney.,July
John Delaney,"Thank you Jake. John F. Kennedy famously said, “We should not seek the Republican answer. We should not seek the Democratic answer. We should seek the right answer.” He was right when he said, and he’s right today as well.",July
John Delaney,"Donald Trump is the symptom of a disease, and the disease is divisiveness. I’m the only one on this stage talking about curing that disease with big ideas like national service by focusing on actually solving problems. If we work together, we can fix healthcare and build infrastructure. We can invest in not just technology but people and entrepreneurs, whether they be in Storm Lake, Iowa or Detroit, Michigan or Baltimore, Maryland.",July
John Delaney,"We can fight climate change and reimagine our education system, but we have to do it with real solutions not impossible promises. Isn’t it time we had a president who was a leader in both the private sector and in government to lead us into the future? I promise as president I will restore vision, unity, and leadership and decency to this country. That’s why I’m running for president. Thank you.",July
Jake Tapper,Congressman Ryan.,July
Tim Ryan,"In a few minutes, all of the pundits are going to be looking at this debate and saying, “Well, who captured the left lane? Who captured the center lane? Who captured the moderate lane?” I hope tonight at some level I captured your imagination, your imagination about what this country could be like if we united, if we put together real policies that weren’t left or right but new and better. That’s how we win the future. It’s new and better.",July
Tim Ryan,"A new and better economy. A new and better education system. A new and better healthcare system that focuses on prevention. An education system that focuses on the trauma of our kids. There’s not going to be a savior, not going to be a superstar that’s going to fix all this. It’s going to be you and me. It’s going to be us. That’s how we fix this country. You and I coming together to do big things to imagine the new country that we want by coming together. Not left or right, new and better.",July
Jake Tapper,Governor Hickenlooper.,July
John H,Thank you. What a night. I’ve loved it. I’d like to ask every American to imagine that you are facing life threatening surgery tomorrow. Would you choose a doctor who had a track record of proven success who’d actually done the work or someone who had just talked about it? That’s the question we’re facing in this primary.,July
John H,"I’ve actually got a track record as a small business owner, as a mayor and as a governor. We expanded healthcare in Colorado and got near universal coverage. We fought climate change directly. We beat the NRA. For the last three years, we’ve been the number one economy in the country. We can ramp all that out.",July
John H,"I’m as progressive as anybody up on this stage, but I’m also pragmatic. I’ve done the things that most of these other people are just talking about, and I know I can get results. I can lead the people of this country toward a stronger, a healthier and a more secure future and defeat Donald Trump and return this country to its glory. Thank you.",July
Jake Tapper,Senator,July
Amy Klobuchar,"Well, thank you Detroit. To win we have to listen to people. Out there today is Casey Joe’s mom. Casey Joe was a champion high school swimmer from a small town. She got sick, went to the emergency room and got hooked on opioids. The last thing that she said to her mom was, “Momma, it’s not my fault,” and she died.",July
Amy Klobuchar,"A lot of Americans say the same thing every day, and that is what I will stand up for. What I will stand up against are companies like those pharma companies that got her hooked on those opioids and didn’t tell the doctors or the patients what was going to happen.",July
Amy Klobuchar,"We need someone that has people’s back. We also need someone that can win, and I have won in these red districts. I win in the Midwest. I can win in states like Wisconsin, and Michigan and Iowa. I also will do my job without fear or favor just like I did as a prosecutor and get through the gridlock like I’ve done as a senator where I’ve passed over a hundred bills where I’ve been the lead Democrat.",July
Amy Klobuchar,"Last, yes, I will govern with integrity. We have the President where people turn off their TV when they see him. Not me. I will make you proud as your president.",July
Jake Tapper,Congressman O’Rourke.,July
Beto O’Rourke,"We are as divided and polarized as a country as we have ever been. Right now we have a President who uses fear to try to drive us further apart. To meet this challenge, we have to have hope in one another and a faith in a future of this country that includes everyone.",July
Beto O’Rourke,"My whole life I’ve been including people in the success of this country. Starting a business with high value, high wage, high skilled jobs in the third poorest urban county in America. Serving on the city council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that I serve at the end of the day. In Congress, being in the minority but working with Democrats and Republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country.",July
Beto O’Rourke,"Then in Texas this last year, traveling to every county not writing anybody off, not taking anyone for granted. At the end of the day, winning more votes than any Democrat had in the history of the state. Winning independence for the first time in decades, and winning nearly half a million Republicans and those 38 Electoral College votes in Texas are now in play. I can win them. That is how we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020 and how we bring this divided country together again in January of 2021. Thank you.",July
Jake Tapper,Mayor Buttigieg,July
Pete Buttigieg,"There’s good news and bad news. I’m going to start with the bad news. Our country’s in trouble. GPD is going up, and life expectancy is going down. Think about what that means. It’s only getting tougher. By 2030, we will have passed the point of no return on climate. There could be 130 million more guns on our streets. I’ll be in my 40s then. If you have kids, think about how old they will be then.",July
Pete Buttigieg,"Here’s the good news. It’s not too late. We can tell our kids that before we ran out of time, just before we ran out of time in 2020, we did what it took to deliver a climate that we didn’t have to wonder if it could support us, to deliver a society where race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your relationship with law enforcement, that we did what it took to deliver an economy where a rising tide actually does lift all boats.",July
Pete Buttigieg,"We can do this if and only if we are ready to walk away from what hasn’t worked with bold action and win, not only defeat this President but defeat his congressional allies with a defeat so big that it reunites the Republican Party with its conscience as well as bringing Democrats to office. Join me and let’s make it happen.",July
Jake Tapper,Senator Warren.,July
Elizabeth W.,"From the time I was seven years old, I had a dream. I wanted to be a public school teacher, but my daddy ended up as a janitor. By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn’t have the money to send me off to college. My big chance was what was then a commuter college that cost $50 a semester.",July
Elizabeth W.,"For me, what this election is all about is opportunity. Every budget, every policy that we talk about is about who’s going to get opportunity. Is it going to go to the billionaires, or is it going to go to our kids? Right now for decades, we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful. It has been on the side of the wealthy. That means it has not been on the side of everyone else. Not on the side of people living on our Native American reservations, people living in inner cities, people living on small farms and small communities across this country.",July
Elizabeth W.,"How do we beat it? We beat it by being the party of big structural change. Give people a reason to show up and vote. We beat it by building a grassroots movement across this country, not showing up behind closed doors with millionaires but actually building it person-by-person across this country with small dollar donations, with volunteers, with people who show up and say, “I have a stake in this democracy.”",July

Bernie Sanders,"As somebody who grew up in a family that lived in a rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York and lived paycheck to paycheck, I’m running for president not just to defeat the most dangerous president in this history of this country, a guy who’s a racist, and a sexist and a homophobe. I’m running to transform this country and to stand with the working class of America, which for the last 45 years has been decimated.",July
Bernie Sanders,"Two days ago, I had a remarkable experience, which should tell you everything you need to know about what’s going on in America. I took 15 people with diabetes from Detroit a few miles into Canada, and we bought insulin for one-tenth the price being charged by the crooks who run the pharmaceutical industry in America today.",July
Bernie Sanders,"It’s not just the price fixing and the corruption and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, it’s what’s going on in the fossil fuel industry. It’s what’s going on in Wall Street. It’s what’s going on with the prison industrial complex. We need a mass political movement.",July

Jake Tapper,00 PM Eastern time for round two. Ten more Democratic candidates for president right back here in Detroit. Now stay tuned for special coverage of tonight’s debate with Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo. That begins right now.,July
Anderson Cooper,"There you have it. Night one of the CNN Democratic Debates here in Detroit. It certainly lived up to the billing in many ways. We saw candidates clashing onstage, sometimes sharply, on policy without resorting to name calling at all. We saw Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren answer tough questions from their opponents and the panel on healthcare and how to pay for it.",July
Anderson Cooper,"There is certainly a clear divide in the Democratic Party right now across a wide range of issues, and that too played out onstage. Now, whether or not, as Senator Warren said a moment ago, Democrats want to be the party of big structural change, it was a serious clash of ideas certainly, and philosophies, and yes, personalities as well.",July
Anderson Cooper,"If you came into this looking to learn what exactly Democrats believed what they think is good for the country and what they think is the best way to beat Donald Trump, well, it was all there tonight on that stage. We’re going to focus on all of it in the hours ahead. My colleague, Chris Cuomo, and I will be talking to some of the candidates who you saw tonight. We’ll of course be joined by some of the best political and journalistic voices around as well.",July
Anderson Cooper,"CNN Chief National Correspondent, John King, is with us. Host of CNN’s Inside Politics, CNN’s Senior Political Reporter, Nia-Malika Henderson, is with us as well. CNN’s Senior Political Commentator, Axe Files Host, and former Senior Obama Advisor, David Axelrod joins us here. CNN’s Chief Political Analyst, Gloria Borger is with us as well. So is CNN Political Commentator and former Clinton 2016 Director of Communications Outreach, Jess McIntosh. Also Van Jones, Host of CNN’s Van Jones Show. Two CNN Political Commentators joining us as well, both are former governors, Jennifer Granholm of Michigan and Terry McAuliffe of Virginia.",July
Anderson Cooper,"A lot to talk about. John King, let’s start with you. Who stood out to you?",July
John King,"Well, what stood out to me I think is the most important. The ideological and generational fight in the Democratic Party is alive, and well and feisty. It was not settled tonight. Right?",July
Anderson Cooper,It continues.,July
John King,"It continues, and it’s going to continue I think deep into the primary season. The big challenge tonight is the great question after tonight and tomorrow night, who gets to continue the fight? So, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders stood their ground tonight. They were in the middle of the stage. They were challenged repeatedly. Can you sell these big ideas? Is the country ready for this? Can the country afford this? Will you hand Donald Trump reelection? I think they both stood feistily and fought back.",July
John King,"Elizabeth Warren from the very beginning saying, “Don’t have small ideas, and don’t be spineless,” a direct challenge to those who were challenging her and Senator Sanders. They did not go at each other. They will have to some day. They hold too much space in this primary to not have a fight at some point, but that was delayed as they held their ground against the moderates.",July
John King,"I think the big question is, which of the moderates survive? That’s not up to us. That’s up to Democratic donors and Democratic voters who have to either send them money or raise them in the polls, because this in some ways, I don’t want to make it reality TV, is about survival. To make the next round of debates, several of those moderates right now don’t meet the test.",July
John King,"So, Governor Bullock, pretty decent night. Do voters believe that? Does he rise up in the polls? Does he get some money?",July
Anderson Cooper,It’s also his first night on a debate stage.,July
John King,"First night. So, he tried to have his introduction as, “I’m from the Trump state. I agree with you on principle, Bernie and Senator Warren, but not on how you want to do it.” The Democratic voters are going to decide who gets to live to fight on, but wow, this is a feisty policy-based ideological fight. It’s going to go for a long time.",July
Anderson Cooper,"Nia-Malika Henderson, certainly former Representative Delaney got a fair amount of attention as a foil to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.",July
Henderson,"He did. That was, I think, one of the best exchanges that Warren had with Delaney when she essentially said, “What’s the presidency for? What are you running for presidency for if it’s all about what you can’t get done, and it’s all about what you’re afraid of?” She kept essentially saying that the moderates were basically spouting GOP talking points, and why are the moderates getting caught in that trap.",July

Jake Tapper,"Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate. Candidates, we’re about to begin opening statements but first, a quick review of the ground rules that your campaigns agreed to earlier this month to try to ensure a fair debate. As moderators, we will attempt to guide the discussion. You will each receive one minute to answer questions, 30 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 additional seconds if a moderator asks for a clarification. The timing lights will remind you of these limits. Please respect them and please refrain from interrupting other candidates during their allotted time. A candidate infringing on another candidate’s time will have his or her time reduced. We again remind our audience inside the Fox Theater to try to remain silent when candidates are actively debating. The candidates need to be able to properly hear the questions and each other.",July
Dana Bash,"Let’s start with opening statements. You will each receive one minute. Mayor Bill de Blasio, please begin.",July
Bill de Blasio,"To the working people of America, tonight I bring you a message of hope. We can make change in this country. I know from personal experience it can be done. When I became the mayor of the nation’s largest city, I set us on a path of bold change. They said it couldn’t be done, but we gave pre-K to every child for free. We got rid of Stop and Frisk and we lowered crime. We raise the minimum wage to $15.00 an hour, yes, it can be done. Now tonight we have to get to the heart and soul of who we are as Democrats. There are good people on this stage, but there are real differences. Joe Biden told wealthy donors that nothing fundamentally would change if he were president.",July
Bill de Blasio,"Kamala Harris said she’s not trying to restructure society. Well, I am. For 40 years, working people have taken it on the chin in this country. For 40 years, the rich and gotten richer and they paid less and less in taxes. It cannot go on this way. When I am president, we will even up the score and we will tax the hell out of the wealthy to make this a fairer country and to make sure it’s a country that puts working people first.",July
Dana Bash,Thank you Mayor de Blasio. Senator Michael Bennet.,July
Michael Bennet,"Thank you. Last week I saw one of those Trump signs that says “America, love it or leave it” and it was on the outside of the church. I love America and I know we can make it better. Before coming to the Senate, I ran a large urban school district where most of the kids live in poverty. Those kids have exactly the same hopes that I had. Their parents have exactly the same hopes for them that my parents had for me. And that Susan and I had for our three children. But for the last three years we’ve been consumed by a president who frankly doesn’t give a damn about your kids or mine. Mr. President, kids belong in classrooms, not cages. And they deserve something better than a bully in the White House. Let’s end this three ring circus in Washington and let’s make this election about reclaiming our future for our kids and our democracy. Empty promises won’t beat Donald Trump, I can.",July
Dana Bash,Governor Jay Inslee.,July
Jay Inslee,"Good evening, I’m Jay Inslee. I am running for president because the people in this room and the Democrats watching tonight are the last best hope for humanity on this planet. If we make defeating the climate crisis the top priority of the United States, we will have a fighting chance to save ourselves and our children’s future. It has to be our top priority. My plan is one of national mobilization, quickly bringing 100% clean energy to Americans, creating eight million good union jobs. This is a big, bold, ambitious plan for clean energy for a big, bold, ambitious nation. Middle ground approaches are not enough. We must confront the fossil fuel industry. I’ve been working on this for 25 years and now we know this, we’re a tipping point. And whether we shrink from this challenge or rise to it is the vital question of our time. We Democrats believe we can still do big things in this nation. We can defeat the climate crisis. Let’s get to work.",July

Kirsten G.,"My grandmother taught me that nothing’s impossible. She spent two generations organizing women in upstate New York. My mother taught me nothing’s impossible. She was one of my only three women in her law school class and worked with gay couples for basic rights. If you want to get something done just tell me it’s impossible. As a freshman senator, I was told you couldn’t repeal don’t ask, don’t tell. Even numbers of my own party told me it wasn’t convenient. When are civil rights ever convenient? We stood up to the Pentagon and we got it done, not impossible. 10 years ago, I was told you couldn’t pass healthcare for our 9/11 first responders. Those heroes who raced up the towers when others were coming down. Even when Congress turned its back on them, we kept fighting. Just last week we made the 9/11 health bill permanent. Beating Donald Trump, definitely not impossible. We need a nominee who will take on the big fights and win. We need a nominee who doesn’t know the meaning of impossible.",July

I know what patriotism is and I’ve known many great patriots throughout my life. And let me tell you this, Donald Trump is not behaving like a patriot. As president, I will bring this spirit of real patriotism to the White House, serving the interest of all Americans, not just the rich and powerful. I’ll fight for our rights and freedoms of all Americans upholding these principles in our constitution upon which our country was founded. Fighting for justice and equality for all. Fighting for every single American, regardless of race or religion as we strive towards that more perfect union. And as president, I’ll bring this unifying spirit of love for country and the soldiers values of service above self to the White House, truly leading a government of, by and for the people.",July

Julian Castro,"Thank you Dana and good evening. Just a few days ago we were reminded and inspired by our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico. That public service is not fundamentally about any of us. It’s about you and your family. I want you to know that if I’m elected president, that I will work hard every single day so that you and your family can have good healthcare when you need it. So that your children and grandchildren can get a good education so that they can reach their dreams, and then you can have good job opportunities. Whether you live here in a big city like Detroit or in a small town in our country. I know we have a wonderful, special nation but that too many people are struggling and I know what that’s like too. I grew up with a single mom in a poor neighborhood. But like many of you, I don’t want to make America anything again. I don’t want us to go backwards. We’re not going back to the past. We’re not going back where we came from. We’re going to move forward. We’re going to make America better than it’s ever been in the years to come. Let’s do that together.",July

Andrew Yang,"If you heard anything about me and my campaign, you’ve heard that someone is running for president who wants to give every American $1,000 a month. I know this may sound like a gimmick but this is a deeply American idea. From Thomas Payne to Martin Luther King to today. Let me tell you why we need to do it and how we pay for it. Why do we need to do it? We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs and chances are your job could be next. If you don’t believe me, just ask an auto worker here in Detroit. How do we pay for it? Raise your hand in the crowd if you’ve seen stores closing where you live. It is not just you, Amazon is closing 30% of America’s stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it. We need to do the opposite of much of what we’re doing right now. And the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math. So let me share the math. On $1,000 a month for every adult would be $461 million every month right here in Detroit alone. The automation of our jobs is a central challenge facing us today. It is why Donald Trump is our president and any politician not addressing it is failing the American people.",July

Donald Trump from Charleston to Baltimore to even the border is using the tired old language of demagogues, of fear-mongers, of racists to try to divide our country against itself. We know who Donald Trump is but in this election the question is who are we as a people? We have serious problems in America. We have deep wounds and seriously, deeply rooted challenges. We desperately need to heal as a nation and move forward. Because we know in this country that our fates are united, that we have a common destiny. The call of this election is the call to unite in common cause and common purpose. That’s how we will beat Donald Trump.

This is a moment in time that is requiring us each as individuals and collectively to look in a mirror and ask the question, that question being, who are we? And I think most of us know that part of the answer to that question is we are better than this. So this then becomes a moment that we must fight for the best of who we are and fight of course we will. And this is not a new fight for us as Americans. We have always been prepared to fight for our ideals. We have always been a nation that fights for the best of who we are. And I’ll tell you, I come from fighters. My parents met when they were active in the civil rights movement. My sister Maya and I joke, we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults, who spent full time marching and shouting about this thing called justice.

Just look at this stage made up of very diverse people from diverse backgrounds. Went on to be mayors, senators, governors, congresswomen, members of the cabinet and yes, even a vice president. Mr. President, this is America and we are stronger and great because of this diversity, Mr. President. Not in spite of it, Mr. President. So Mr. President, let’s get something straight. We love it, we are not leaving it. We are here to stay and we’re certainly not going to leave it to you.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Vice President Biden. I want to start the debate with one of the top priorities for democratic voters and that is healthcare. Senator Harris, this week you released a new healthcare plan which would preserve private insurance and take 10 years to phase in. Vice President Biden’s campaign calls your plan, “a have-it-every-which-way approach” and says it’s just part of a confusing pattern of equivocating about your healthcare stance. What do you say to that?",July
Kamala Harris,"Well, they’re probably confused because they’ve not read it, but the reality is that I have been spending time in this campaign listening to American families. Listening to experts, listening to healthcare providers and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people. Responsive to their needs, understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long. That American families have to be held down by deductibles and copays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy.",July
Kamala Harris,"I listened to the American families who said four years is just not enough to transition into this new plan. So I devised a plan where it’s going to be 10 years of a transition. I listened to American families who said, I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan. So I designed a plan where yes, responsive to the needs of American families, there will be a public plan under my plan for Medicare and a private plan under my plan for Medicare. Because the bottom line is this, we must agree that access to healthcare must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And in America today, far too many people, in fact, 30 million people are going without access to healthcare.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you Senator Harris. Vice President Biden, your response.",July
Joe Biden,"Well my response is that is the Senator’s had several plans so far. And anytime someone tells you you’re going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it takes 10 years. If you noticed there’s no talk about the fact that the plan in 10 years will cost $3 trillion. You will lose your employer based insurance. And in fact, this is the single most important issue facing the public. And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward, you can’t beat President Trump with double talk on this plan.",July
Dana Bash,"Your response, Senator Harris.",July
Kamala Harris,"Absolutely. Unfortunately, Vice President Biden, you’re just simply inaccurate in what you’re describing. The reality is that our plan will bring healthcare to all Americans under a Medicare For All system. Our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day. Babies will be born into our plan and right now four million babies almost are born every day in America or every year in America. Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to healthcare. Your plan by contrast, leaves out almost 10 million Americans. So I think that you should really think about what you’re saying, but be reflective and understand that the people of America want access to healthcare and do not want costs to be their barrier to getting it.",July
Dana Bash,"Senator Harris, thank you. Vice President Biden, your response.",July
Joe Biden,"The plan, no matter how you cut it cost $3 trillion when it is in fact employed. Number one, 10 years from now after two terms of the senator being president, after her time. Secondly, it will require middle-class taxes to go up, not down. Thirdly, it will eliminate employer based insurance and fourthly, what happens in the meantime?",July
Kamala Harris,"I’d like to respond. First of all, the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive. Second, we are now paying $3 trillion a year for healthcare in America. Over the next 10 years, it’s probably going to be $6 trillion. We must act. My plan is about immediately allowing people to sign up and get into coverage. Right now in America, we have seniors who everyday, millions of seniors are going into the Medicare system and they are getting full coverage and the kind of coverage they need. All people should have access to healthcare and and costs should not be-",July

Bill de Blasio,"Thank you. I don’t know what the Vice President or Senator are talking about. The folks I talked to about health insurance say that their health insurance isn’t working for them. There’s tens of millions of Americans who don’t even have health insurance, tens of millions more who have health insurance they can barely make work because of the copays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out-of-pocket expenses. There’s this mythology that somehow all these folks are in love with their insurance in America. What I hear from union members and from hardworking, middle-class people is, they wish they had better insurance.",July

Joe Biden,"My response is Obamacare is working. The way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on Obamacare. Go back and do… take back all the things that Trump took away, provide a public option, meaning every single person in America would be able to buy into the option if they didn’t like their employer plan or if they’re on Medicaid, they’d automatically be in the plan. It would be taking place immediately, it would move quickly, and it would insure the vast, vast, vast majority of Americans.",July

When I was a young mother and had Theo as an infant, he had an allergic reaction to eggs and his whole body turned red and puffy. I had to rush him to the emergency room. My heart is palpitating, because I’m worried that his throat will close. I am not worried about not having an insurance card, or a credit card in my wallet. I know whatever they’re going to prescribe, whether it’s an EpiPen or an inhaler, I can afford it. The truth about healthcare in America today is people can’t afford it. They cannot afford, and these insurance companies, for these plans that rely on insurance companies, I’m sorry.",July
Kirsten G.,"They’re for profit companies. They have an obligation to their shareholders. They pay their CEO millions of dollars. They have to have quarterly profits. They have fat in the system that’s real and it should be going to healthcare. So let’s not lose the forest through the trees and last, let’s not forget what the Republicans are doing.

In terms of the point that Senator Gillibrand is raising, I couldn’t agree more. Senator Biden, your plan will keep and allow insurance companies to remain with status quo, doing business as usual.

Secondly, the idea that this is somehow a bad idea, no one has to keep their private insurance, but if they like their insurance, they should be able to keep it. Nothing is demanded in my plan that there be private insurance, it says, “If the 160 million people who have it say they like their employer insurance, they should have a right to have it.

You also say you are not going to pull private health insurance from more than 150 million Americans, in exchange for a government plan. But that’s what Medicare for All would do, so how do you square that?",July
Cory Booker,"Well, first of all, let me just say that the person that’s enjoying this debate most right now is Donald Trump, as we pit Democrats against each other while he is working right now to take away Americans’ healthcare. There’s a court case working through the system that’s going to gut the Affordable Care Act and actually gut protections on pre-existing conditions. And so I was raised by two Civil Rights parents who told me to always keep your eyes on the prize and that is that the United States of America, every Democrat should stand with the belief that everyone should have access to healthcare. That it’s a human right. And how we get there, it has to be to end this broken system, because we are on our way in just a handful of years, of literally spending 20% of our economy, one out of every $5 spent on healthcare.",July
Cory Booker,"And we spend more than every other nation, on everything from MRIs to insulin drugs, multiple more than other countries. And so you want to know what I’m going to do? I’m going to work to get us to a point where Medicare for all, where everyone is covered. But this pitting against progressives against moderates, saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn’t care enough, that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in the face of the real enemy here.",July

Cory Booker,And I’m going to keep fighting for that.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Booker. Congressman Gabbard, what’s your response?",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"The reality is right now, we don’t have a healthcare system. We have a sick care system, and there are far too many people in this country who are sick and unable to get the care that they need because they cannot afford it. So the core of this problem is the fact that big insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies who’ve been profiting off the backs of sick people have had a seat at the table writing this legislation. Now, Kamala Harris just talked about Kathleen Sibelius who helped write her bill. This just pointed to the fatal flaw in her proposal.",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"Sibelius works for Medicare Advantage, private insurance company who will stand to profit under her plan. If we’re seeking to really reform our healthcare system, we’ve got to shut out big insurance and big pharma, out of the drafting process so that they cannot continue to profit off the backs of the sick people in this country who are searching and in desperate need of care.",July
Dana Bash,"Senator Harris, your response?",July
Kamala Harris,"Well, unfortunately Representative Gabbard got it wrong. Kathleen Sibelius did not write my plan, she endorsed it as being one of the plans that is the best to get us to a place where everyone’s going to have access to healthcare in America. And when we talk about this again, I’m going to go back to Vice President Biden, because your plan does not cover everyone in America, by your staff’s and your own definition. 10 million people, as many as 10 million people will not have access to healthcare. And in 2019 in America, for a Democrat to be running for President with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse.",July

The bio pharma is now where things are going to go, it’s no longer chemicals, it’s about all these breakthroughs we have with generally the whole, excuse me, immune system. And what we have to do now is we have to have a form that sits in the HHS and says, “As you develop a drug, you’ve got to come to us and decide what you can sell it for.

I believe we should finish the job we started with the Affordable Care Act with a public option that gives everybody in this audience the chance to pick for their family whether they want private insurance or public insurance.",July
Michael Bennet,"It requires drug companies to be negotiated with by Medicare, and it provides competition. That is totally different from the plan that Senator Warren and Senator Sanders and Senator Harris have proposed, which would make illegal employer-based health insurance in this country, and massively raise taxes on the middle class, to the tune of $30 trillion dollars, as Joe Biden said. We don’t need to do that. It doesn’t make sense for us to take away insurance from half the people in this room and put huge taxes on almost everybody in this room, when we can pass a public option.

That whole time, she had Medicare. I want to strengthen Medicare for the people who are on it, and then expand it to anybody who wants it. I also believe though that if somebody has a private health insurance plan that is strong, that they want to hold onto, that they should be able to do that. What I don’t believe is that the profit motive of big pharma or big insurance companies should ever determine in our great nation, whether somebody gets healthcare or not.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Secretary Castro. Senator Harris, Senator Bennet had suggested that you support banning employer-based health insurance. Is that true?",July
Kamala Harris,"Well, first of all with all due respect to my friend Michael Bennet, my plan does not offer anything that is illegal. What it does is it separates the employer from healthcare, meaning that where you work will not be a, the kind of healthcare you get will not be a function of where you work. I have met so many Americans who stick to a job that they do not like, where they are not prospering, simply because they need the healthcare that that employer provides.",July

We need to be honest about what’s in this plan. It bans employer-based insurance and taxes the middle class to the tune of $30 trillion dollars. Do you know how much that is? That is 70% of what the government will collect in taxes over the next 10 years. We don’t need to do that.",July

Employers are not going to be able to dictate the kind of healthcare that their employees get. They will be able to make that decision. Private insurance companies and private carriers, if they comply by our rules and play by our rules, we’ll be able to offer those employees healthcare coverage under a private Medicare plan, or they can have the option of a public Medicare plan. But it is misleading to suggest that employees want what their employer is offering only, they want choice and my plan gives that to them.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator. Governor Inslee, I want to bring you in. You recently signed a public option into law, which allows Washington state residents to purchase a state-backed plan if they want to, but this may only save families in Washington state as little as 5% off premiums. Is 5% really the kind of relief that the American people need?",July
Jay Inslee,"No, we need universal coverage and I’m proud of our state that has done less squabbling and actually getting things done. And I am proud that we are the first state to offer a publicly sanctioned offer of healthcare to our citizens. I’m also proud that we didn’t stop there. We’re also the first state that has taken care of our elders, our seniors. We have a looming retirement wave coming up, I’m proud that our state has made them eligible to retire in dignity.",July
Jay Inslee,"I’m also proud of this, and I think we need to talk more about this as Democrats. It is time to give people adequate mental healthcare in this country. And we are having, we are having some success in integrating mental health with physical health. There’s no reason we should distinguish between your physiological and your mental health. And the last thing we’re doing, I think it’s very instructive for the nation, we know we’re being eaten alive by pharmaceutical costs. We’ve had one of, if not the most innovate way to drive down pharmaceuticals for life-saving medications in the United States. That’s a record of Washington state I’d like to take to Washington DC.",July

That’s a true story and it’s not just us, Democrats are talking about healthcare in the wrong way. As someone who’s run a business, I can tell you flat out our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire. It makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees. It makes it harder to switch jobs, as Senator Harris just said, and it’s certainly a lot harder to start a business. If we say, “Look, we’re going to get healthcare off the backs of businesses and families, then watch American entrepreneurship recover and bloom.” That’s the argument we should be making to the American people.",July

Ask them what they feel about the health insurance companies, they feel it’s holding back their families because they can’t get the coverage they need. They get a lot of nos, they don’t get a lot of help from health insurance companies. Why are we not going to be the party that does something bold?

No one has to keep their private insurance, they can buy into this plan, and they can buy into it with a $1,000 deductible, and never have to pay more than 8.5% of their income when they do it. And if they don’t have any money, they’ll get in free. So this idea is a bunch of malarkey, what we’re talking about here.",July
Joe Biden,"The fact of the matter is, the fact of the matter is that there will be a deductible, it’ll be a deductible in their paycheck. Bernie acknowledges it. Bernie acknowledges $30 trillion dollars has to all be paid, and I don’t know what math you do in New York, I don’t know what math you do in California, but I tell you, that’s a lot of money. And there will be a deductible. The deductible will be out of your paycheck, because that’s what would be required.",July
Jake Tapper,"Senator Harris, I want to bring you in here. Your response?",July
Kamala Harris,"Yeah, let’s talk about math. Let’s talk about math. Let’s talk about the fact that the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies last year along profited $72 billion dollars, and that is on the backs of American families. And under your plan, status quo, you do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to American families. In America today, a diabetes patient, one in four cannot afford their insulin. In America today-",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Kamala Harris,"For those people who have overdosed from an opioid, there is a syringe that costs $4,000-",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Kamala Harris,"That will save their life. It is immoral, it is untenable-",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Kamala Harris,And it must change with Medicare for All.,July
Jake Tapper,"Time is up, Senator.",July
Kamala Harris,"Vice President Biden, your response?",July
Joe Biden,"The deal is, let’s figure out how this works. We immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off of their insurance plan they don’t like, no matter what one it is, and-",July
Joe Biden,"Off of their insurance plan they don’t like, no matter what one it is and buy into a Medicare option. And they can buy the Gold Plan and they’re not going to have to pay. Anyway.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President, thank you. Let’s move now to immigration, please.",July
Don Lemon,"Secretary Castro, you think it should no longer be a crime to cross the US border illegally. President Obama’s Homeland Security Secretary Jay Johnson, whom you served with, says that is a public declaration that the border is “effectively open to all.” How is he wrong?",July
Julian Castro,"Thank you for that question. You know, if you elect me president, you’re not electing me to follow, you’re electing me to lead. Open borders is a right wing talking point, and frankly I’m disappointed that some folks, including some folks on this stage have taken the bait. The only way that we’re going to guarantee that we don’t have family separations in this country again is to repeal section 1325 of the Immigration Nationality Act. That is the law that this President, this administration is using to incarcerate migrant parents and then physically separate them from their children.",July
Julian Castro,"My immigration plan would also make sure that we put undocumented immigrants who haven’t committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship. That we do a 21st century Marshall Plan with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala so that we can get to the root of this challenge, so people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to come the United States. That’s how we can be smarter, more effective, and more humane when it comes to immigration policy.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Secretary Castro. Senator Bennet, what’s your response?",July
Michael Bennet,"I disagree that we should decriminalize our border. This is personal for me, my mom’s an immigrant and she was separated from her parents during the Holocaust in Poland. For those reasons, I was part of the Gang of Eight that wrote, I wrote the immigration bill in 2013 with John McCain that passed the senate with 68 votes. That gave a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented people that are here, that would pass the most aggressive dream act that ha ever been conceived much less passed on the floor of the senate, and had 46 billion dollars of border security.",July
Michael Bennet,Every single Democrat voted for that bill.,July
Don Lemon,Senator-,July
Michael Bennet,And a lot of Republicans. That should be our position.,July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Michael Bennet,That is our position.,July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Harris, you have indicated that do you think it should be a criminal offense punishable by jail to cross the US border illegally. How do you respond to senator Bennet?",July
Kamala Harris,"Well, again, with all due respect, after the last debate for example, I went to a place in Florida called Homestead. There is a private detention facility being paid for by your tax payer dollars, a private detention facility that currently houses 2700 children. By the way, there were members of us… Julian was there, members of Congress. They would not let us enter the place, members of the United States Congress. So I walked down the road, I climbed a ladder and I looked over the fence and I’m going to tell you what I saw.",July
Kamala Harris,"I saw children lined up single file based on gender, being walked into barracks. The policies of this administration have been facilitated by laws on the book that allow them to be incarcerated as though they’ve committed crimes.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Kamala Harris,These children have not committed crimes and should be not treated like criminals.,July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Senator Harris. Senator Bennet, what’s your response?",July
Michael Bennet,I think this is one in the end that we agree with. There’s not a single person on this stage who if we were president would ever separate a child from their parents at the border.,July
Michael Bennet,"That is what this administration has done in the American people’s name. They have turned our border into a symbol of nativist hostility. The symbol of this country before Donald Trump was president was the Statue of Liberty. That should be the symbol of the United States of America, not Donald Trump’s terrible .",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Senator Bennet. Senator Gillibrand, I’m going to bring you in, what’s your response?",July
Kirsten G.,"So, I think when you talk about whether this should be a crime, you have to remember who we’re talking about. When I was at the Texas border, I visited with women who had fled violence. A woman from El Salvador, owned a small business, gangs came to her and said, “If you don’t give us all your money, we’re going to kill your family.” That’s why she fled.",July
Kirsten G.,"Another woman was raped, that’s why she fled. So this is who we’re talking about, and they’re not criminals. So I believe that we should have a civil violation. No president before President Trump enforced the law in the way he has enforced it, because he’s using it as the crutch to lock up women and children, to separate mothers and babies, to put them behind bars. So I don’t think we should have a law on the books that could be so misused. It should be a civil violation, and we should make sure that we treat people humanely.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden, in the first two years of the Obama administration, nearly 800 thousand immigrants were deported, far more than during President Trump’s first two years. Would the higher deportation rates resume if you are president?",July
Joe Biden,"Absolutely not, number one. Number two, everything landed on the President’s desk but locusts. I found that Julian, excuse me, the secretary, we sat together in many meetings. I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary.",July
Crowd,Three million deportations! Three million deportations!,July
Don Lemon,Please be respectful. Please be respectful in the crowd.,July
Crowd,Three million deportations!,July
Don Lemon,"Please continue, Mr. Vice President.",July
Crowd,Three million deportations! Three million deportations! Three million deportations!,July
Joe Biden,"The fact is… I don’t know if you can hear, I can hear, but I don’t know.",July
Don Lemon,"We can hear fine, Mr. Vice President. Please continue if you will.",July
Joe Biden,"The fact is, what the senator from New York talked about is seeking asylum. The women she spoke to are entitled to asylum. That is not crossing the border illegally. What we should do is flood the zone to make sure we have people to make those decisions quickly.",July
Joe Biden,"With regard to the Secretary’s point. I already proposed and passed 750 million dollars for Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to be able to change the circumstance, why people fled in the first place. In addition to that, we’re in a circumstance where if in fact you say you can just cross the border, what do you say to all those people around the world who in fact want the same thing, to come to the United States and make their case? And if they don’t, that they have to wait in line.",July
Joe Biden,"The fact of the matter is, you should be able to, if you cross the border illegally you should be able to be sent back, it’s a crime. It’s a crime, and it’s not one that in fact-",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Secretary Castro, please your response.",July
Julian Castro,"Yeah, uh, first of all Mr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn’t. Let me begin by telling you-",July
Julian Castro,"Let me just start out by answering that question. My immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system, because we do have a problem with that. Secondly, the only way that we’re going to guarantee that these kinds of family separations don’t happen in the future is that we need to repeal this law. There’s still going to be consequences if somebody crosses the border. It’s a civil action.",July
Julian Castro,"Also, we have 654 miles of fencing. We have thousands of personnel at the border. We have planes, we have boats.",July
Don Lemon,Secretary-,July
Julian Castro,"We have helicopters, we have security cameras.",July
Don Lemon,"Secretary Castro, thank you.",July
Julian Castro,What we need are politicians-,July
Don Lemon,Your time is up.,July
Julian Castro,… that actually have some guts. on this issue.,July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Secretary. Mr. Vice President, please your response.",July
Joe Biden,"I have guts enough to say his plan doesn’t make sense. Here’s the deal. The fact of the matter is that in fact when people cross the border illegally, it is illegal to do it unless they’re seeking asylum. People should have to get in line, that’s the problem. And the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of Donald Trump. We should defeat Donald Trump and end this practice.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you. Congresswoman Gabbard, what’s your response?",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"Our hearts break when we see those children at these detention facilities who’ve been separated from their parents. When we see human beings crowded into cages in abhorrent, inhumane conditions.",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"This is about leadership, and understanding that we can and should have both secure borders as well as humane immigration policies. We will have to stop separating children from their parents. Make it so it’s easier for people to seek asylum in this country, make sure that we are securing our borders and making it so that people are able to use our legal immigration system by reforming those laws.",July
Don Lemon,"Mr. Yang, your response.",July
Yang,I’m the son of immigrants myself. My father immigrated here as a graduate student and generated over 65 US patents for GE and IBM. I think that’s a pretty good deal for the United States. That’s the immigration story we need to be telling. We can’t always be focusing on some of the distress stories.,July
Yang,"And if you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find wall to wall immigrants. You will find wall to wall robots and machines. Immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have nothing to do with in our economy.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. Senator Booker, you have a plan that would, “Virtually eliminate immigration detention.” Does that mean that the roughly 55 thousand migrants currently in detention would be released into the United States?",July
Cory Booker,"Well first of all, I just want to say again tonight we are playing into Republican hands, who have a very different view and they’re trying to divide us against each other. I’m listening to the language of my colleagues. No, Mr. Vice President, we are not going to just let people cross the border.",July
Cory Booker,"And unlawful crossing is an unlawful crossing if you do it in the civil courts, or if you do it through the criminal courts. But the criminal courts is what is giving Donald Trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country, who no one surrenders their human rights.",July
Cory Booker,"And so doing it through the civil courts means that you won’t need these awful detention facilities, that I’ve been to, seeing children sleeping on pavement, people being put in cages, nursing mothers, small children. This is not necessary. We have seen, using the civil system, piloted programs that have 100% compliance with the civil courts, where people are evaluated. If they have no justifiable reason to be here, they are returned.",July
Cory Booker,"If they are, like the people I met in Juarez who were survivors of sexual assault, who we wouldn’t even let come and present for asylum. We are butchering our values, and making ourselves less safe.",July
Don Lemon,"Senator Booker, thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, your response.",July
Joe Biden,"I agree with the Senator. The asylum process is a real process and this president is ruining it, it has nothing to do with that section of the law. That’s what he’s doing, number one.",July
Joe Biden,"Number two, we should in fact, and we have proposed and we tried to get past our administration, proposed significantly increasing the number of legal immigrants who are able to come. This country can tolerate a heck of a lot more people, and the reason we’re the country we are is we’ve been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture. Immigrants built this country, that’s why we’re so special. It took courage, it took resilience, it took absolute confidence for them to come. And we should be encouraging people.",July
Don Lemon,Thank you.,July
Joe Biden,"By the way, anybody who crosses the stage with a PhD, you should get a green card for seven years. We should keep them here.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Governor Inslee, what’s your response?",July
Jay Inslee,"I think we’re missing two central statements we need to make. Number one, we can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the White House, number one.",July
Jay Inslee,"Number two… Number two, we have to make America what it’s always been, a place of refuge. We’ve got to boos the number of people we except. I’m proud of being the first governor saying, “Send us your Syrian refugees.” I’m proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump’s Muslim ban. I’m proud to have sued him 21 times and beat him 21 times in a row, I’m ready for November 2020.",July
Don Lemon,"Go ahead, Mayor de Blasio, please your response.",July
Bill de Blasio,"Two points. One, it’s all kind of a charade because there’s 11 million people here, and everyone in theory has broken the law, but they’re part of our communities now, they’re part of our economy, they’re our neighbors. Why are we even discussing on one level whether it’s a civil penalty or a criminal penalty, when it’s an American reality and what we need is comprehensive immigration reform once and for all to fix it.",July
Bill de Blasio,"Second, Vice President Biden, I didn’t hear your response when the issues came up of all those deportations. You were Vice President of the United States, I didn’t hear whether you tried to stop them or not using your power, your influence in the White House. Did you think it was a good idea, or did you think it was something that needed to be stopped?",July
Joe Biden,"The President came along, and he’s the guy that came up with the idea, first time ever, of dealing with the Dreamers. He put that in the law. He talked about a comprehensive plan which he lay before the congress saying that we should find a pathway to citizenship for people. He said we should up the number of people that we’re able to bring into this country.",July
Joe Biden,"Lastly, he also pointed out that we should go to the source of the problem and fix it, where people were leaving in the first place. To compare him to Donald Trump I think is absolutely bizarre.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Congresswoman Gabbard, you are a cosponsor of the College For All Act, which would make public colleges and universities free for all Americans.",July
Don Lemon,"One of the authors of that plan, Senator Sanders believes college should be tuition free for undocumented immigrants as well. Do you?",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"I don’t. I think it’s important for us to fix our legal immigration system and look at the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country who have been suffering as they’ve been living in the shadows, and instead of putting a bandaid on this problem, fix our legal immigration system to provide them with that pathway to legal residency or citizenship so that they are no longer treated as second class citizens in this country.",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"We’ve got to look at the challenge that people all across this country are facing under crushing student debt. This is something that is impacting my generation in a huge way, and I believe that it is our generation that has the bold, creative solutions to be able to solve it. This is about promise for our future and we’ve got to make those kinds of investments.",July
Don Lemon,"Thank you, Congresswoman. Mayor de Blasio, what’s your response?",July
Bill de Blasio,"Yeah, I agree with the Congress member, but I don’t hear an answer from the Vice President, I’m confused. I asked the Vice President point blank, did he use his power to stop those deportations? He went right around the question. Mr. Vice President, you want to be President of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions. I guarantee you if you’re debating Donald Trump, he’s not going to let you off the hook.",July
Bill de Blasio,"So did you say those deportations were a good idea? Or did you go to the President and say, “This is a mistake, we shouldn’t do it.” Which one?",July
Joe Biden,"I was Vice President, I am not the President. I keep my recommendations to him in private. Unlike you, I expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately with him. That’s not what I do.",July
Joe Biden,"What I do say to you is, he moved to fundamentally change the system. That’s what he did. That’s what he did, but much more has to be done. Much more has to be done.",July
Bill de Blasio,I still don’t hear an answer.,July
Don Lemon,"Senator Booker, please respond.",July
Cory Booker,"Well, a couple things. First of all, Mr. Vice President, you can’t have it both ways. You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can’t do it when it’s convenient and then dodge it when it’s not.",July
Cory Booker,"And the second thing, and this really irks me, because I heard the Vice President say that if you’ve got a PhD, you can come right into this country. Well that’s playing into what the Republicans want, to pit some immigrants against other immigrants. Some are from shit hole countries, and some are from worthy countries.",July
Cory Booker,"We need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says everyone has worth and dignity, and this should be a country that honors for everyone. Don’t let the Republicans divide this party against itself.",July
Don Lemon,"Senator, thank you. Mr. Vice President, your response.",July
Joe Biden,"The fact is that’s what I said about this country. We are a country of immigrants, all of us. All of us. Some here came against their will, others came because they in fact thought they could fundamentally change their lives. And they did. The  that’s what we’re talking about. That’s what made us great. And the fact of the matter is, I think the President of the United States, Barack Obama went out of his way to try to change the system and he got pushed back significantly.",July
Don Lemon,"Senator Gillibrand, what’s your response?",July
Kirsten G.,"Again, President Trump, under his administration, seven children died in his custody. Under his administration families have been torn apart. This party is talking about real ideas for the future. We’re talking about what we will do to change America. But we must not forget about our values.",July
Kirsten G.,"We used to believe in this country you should treat others the way you want to be treated. We used to believe in this country we should care about the least among us. Let’s remind the American people who we are, why we are Democrats and why we’re running for president ..",July
Don Lemon,"Senator Gillibrand, thank you very much. The debate will be right back, right after this short break.",July
Jake Tapper,"Welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Debate. We are live from Detroit. I want to turn now to criminal justice. Mr. Vice President, Senator Booker called your new criminal justice reform plan “an inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country.” Why is Senator Booker wrong?",July
Joe Biden,"Well, I don’t … I think he is wrong. I think we should work together. He has a similar plan. I think that we should change the way we look at prisons. Right now, we’re in a situation where when someone is convicted of a drug crime, they end up going to jail and to prison. They should be going to rehabilitation. They shouldn’t be going to prison.",July
Joe Biden,"When in prison, they should be learning to read and write and not just sit in there and learn how to be better criminals. And when they get out of prison, they should be in a situation where they have access to everything they would’ve had before, including Pell grants for education, including making sure that they’re able to have housing, public housing, including they have all the opportunities that were available them because we want them to become better citizens. That’s the essence of what my plan in detail lays out.",July
Joe Biden,"I’m happy to discuss it more in detail if the senator want to, and so I looked at it … Anyway. That’s what I think my plan … I know what my plan does, and I think it’s not dissimilar to what the senator said we should be working together on getting things done. It’s a-",July
Jake Tapper,"Senator, your response?",July
Cory Booker,"Well, my response is that this is a crisis in our country because we have treated issues of race and poverty, mental health and addiction, with locking people up and not lifting them up. And Mr. Vice President has said that since the 1970s, every major crime bill, every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it. And so those are your words, not mine. And this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire, and you claimed responsibility for those laws. And you can’t just now come out with a plan to put out that fire.",July
Cory Booker,"We have got to have far more bold action on criminal justice reform, like having-",July

Joe Biden,"Since 2007, I, for example, tried to get the crack powder cocaine totally … disparity, totally eliminated. In 2007, you became mayor, and you had a police department that was … You went out, and you hired Rudy Giuliani’s guy. You engaged in stop and frisk. You had 75% of those stops reviewed as illegal. You found yourself in this situation with three times as many African-American kids were caught in that chain and caught up. The Justice Department came after you for saying you were engaging in behavior that was inappropriate, and then in fact, and nothing happened, the entire time you were mayor.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you. Senator Booker, you want to respond?",July
Cory Booker,"Well, first of all, I’m grateful that he endorsed my presidency already, but I’ll tell you this. It’s no secret that I inherited a criminal … a police department with massive problems and decades-long challenges. But the head of the ACLU has already said, the head of the New Jersey ACLU, that I put forth national standards setting accountability. Mr. Vice President-",July

Cory Booker,"Mr. Vice President, I didn’t interrupt you.",July
Joe Biden,.,July
Cory Booker,"Please show me that respect, sir. We have a system right now that’s broken, and if you want to compare records, and frankly, I’m shocked that you do, I am happy to do that because all the problems that he is talking about that he created, I actually led the bill that got passed into law that reverses the damage that your bills that you are frankly to correct you, Mr. Vice President, you are bragging, calling it the Biden crime bill up until 2015.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden?",July
Joe Biden,"Number one. The bill he talks about is a bill that, in my … our administration, we passed. We passed that bill that you added onto. That’s the bill, in fact, you passed. And the fact of the matter is secondly, there was nothing done for the entire eight years he was mayor. There was nothing done to deal with the police department that was trouble. Why did you announce in the first day a zero tolerance policy of stop and frisk and hire Rudy Giuliani’s guy in 2007 when I was trying to get rid of the crack cocaine ?",July
Cory Booker,"you’re dipping into the Kool-Aid, and you don’t even know the flavor.",July
Cory Booker,"You need to come to the city of Newark and see the reforms that we put in place. The New Jersey head of the ACLU has said that I embraced reforms, not just in action, but in deed. Sir, you are trying to shift the view from what you created.",July
Cory Booker,"There are people right now in prison for life, for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough on crime, phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroy communities like mine. This isn’t about the past, sir. This is about the present right now.",July

Jake Tapper,"I want to bring in Secretary Castro. Your response, sir?",July
Julian Castro,"sentencing reform, cash bail reform, investing in public defenders, diversion programs. I’m proud that I’m the only candidate that has put forward a police reform plan because we have a police system that is broken and we need to fix it and whether it’s the case of someone like Tamir Rice or Michael Brown or Eric Garner, where the Trump Justice Department just decided not to pursue charges. We do ensure we have a national use of force standard and that we end qualified immunity for police officers so that we can hold them accountable for using excessive force.",July

Jay Inslee,I need to -,July
Jake Tapper,"I want to bring in Governor Inslee. Governor Inslee, your response?",July
Jay Inslee,"Let me suggest that people come out to the state of Washington and see what criminal justice reform looks like, our effort to reduce racial disparity. I’m proud that I was the first governor to offer pardons to thousands of people with drug crimes. Now we’re vacating more tens of thousands. We’ve eliminated the death penalty. And importantly, we’ve done this. When people come out of the legal system and they’ve done their responsibility to the citizens, we need to make sure they can get a job. We have ban the box so that people can actually get a job when they come out.",July
Jay Inslee,"And I’ve got to argue with my friend, Secretary Castro. We haven’t just put forward a plan. We have adopted probably one of the best police accountability measures and train our police officers in deescalation techniques so we have less violence .",July
Jake Tapper,"Secretary Castro, your response to Governor Inslee?",July
Julian Castro,"Well that it’s much more than that because what we see, and this was a good example, the other day of the Department of Justice not going after Officer Pantaleo that … Officer Pantaleo used a chokehold that was prohibited by NYPD. He did that for seven seconds. 11 different times, Eric Garner said that he couldn’t breathe. He knew what he was doing, that he was killing Eric Garner, and yet he has not been brought to justice. That police officer should be off the street.",July
Jake Tapper,"Mayor de Blasio? Mayor de Blasio, why is that police officer still on the force, the one who killed Eric Gardner? Please respond.",July
Bill de Blasio,"Let me tell you. I know the Garner family. They’ve gone through extraordinary pain. They are waiting for justice, and they’re going to get justice. There’s finally going to be justice. I have confidence in that, in the next 30 days in New York. You know why? Because for the first time, we are not waiting on the federal justice department, which told the city of New York that we could not proceed because the justice department was pursuing their prosecution. And years went by, and a lot of pain accrued.",July
Bill de Blasio,"And in the meantime, what I’m working on is making sure, and I have for five years, there will never be another tragedy, they’ll never be another Eric Garner because we’re changing fundamentally how we police.",July

But 38,000 people in the federal system were released under the system.",July
Joe Biden,"And so the fact is that there’s a lot we’ve done. But here’s the deal. The fact is that we’re talking about things that occurred a long, long time ago, and now all of a sudden, I find it fascinating. Everybody’s talking about how terrible I am on these issues. Barack Obama knew exactly who I was. He had 10 lawyers do a background check on everything about me on civil rights and civil liberties, and he chose me, and he said it was the best decision he made.",July

He said we should pay people to stay out of jail because we spend so much when they’re behind bars. Right now, we think we’re saving money.

We should put money directly into people’s hands, certainly, when they come out of prison, but before they go into prison.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Mr Yang. I want to bring in Senator Gillibrand. You heard earlier, Mayor de Blasio respond to Secretary Castro on the question of why the police officer who killed Eric Gardner is still on the NYPD. Was that response adequate? Please respond.",July
Kirsten G.,"No. He should be fired. He should be fired now. I sat down with Eric Garner’s mother, and I can tell you when you’ve lost your son, when he begged for breath, when you know because you have a video, when you know he said, “I can’t breathe,” so many times, over and over again, when you know he used an illegal chokehold, that person should be fired. If I was the mayor, I’d fire him, but as President, I would make sure that we had a full investigation, that the report would be made public, and if I wasn’t satisfied, we would have a consent decree.",July
Jake Tapper,"I want to bring in Senator Harris now. Senator Harris, you have also been quite-",July
Jake Tapper,"Senator Harris now, Senator Harris, you have also been quite critical of Vice President Biden’s policies on race. Specifically on the issue of busing in the 1970s, having benefited from busing when you were a young child. Vice President Biden says that your current position on busing, you’re opposed to federally mandated busing, that that position is the same as his position. Is he right?",July
Kamala Harris,"That is simply false and let’s be very clear about this. When Vice President Biden was in the United States Senate working with segregationist to oppose busing, which was the vehicle by which we would integrate America’s public schools, had I been in the United States Senate at that time, I would have been completely on the other side of the aisle. And let’s be clear about this, had those segregationists their way, I would not be a member of the United States Senate. Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate and Barack Obama would not have been in a position to nominate him for the title he now holds.",July
Kamala Harris,"And so, on that issue, we could not be more apart, which is that the vice president has still failed to acknowledge that it was wrong to take the position that he took at that time. Now I would like to also talk about this conversation about Eric Garner because I too met with his mother, and one of the things that we’ve got to be clear about is that this President of the United States, Donald Trump, while he has been in office, has quietly been allowing the United States Department of Justice to shut down consent decrees, to stop pattern and practice investigations on that case.",July
Kamala Harris,"We also know that the  civil rights division, this is important, the civil rights division of the United States Department of Justice said charges should have been filed, but this United States Department of Justice usurped, and I believe it is because that president did not want those charges to go forward and they overrode a decision by the civil rights division of the United States  Department of Justice. Under my administration the civil rights  will reign and there will be independent investigations.",July
Jake Tapper,Vice President Biden I want to give you a chance to respond to what Senator Harris just said.,July
Joe Biden,"When Senator Harris was the Attorney General for eight years in the state of California, there were two of the most segregated school districts in the country. In Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And she did not, I didn’t see a single solitary time she brought a case against them to desegregate them.",July
Joe Biden,"Secondly, she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there, that in fact was abusing people’s rights. And the fact was that she in fact was told by her own people that her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorneys like me, that you in fact have been, the police officer did something that did not give you information that would explicate your client. She didn’t do that. She never did it. And so what happened? Along came a federal judge and said, “Enough, enough,” and he freed  a thousand of these people. If you doubt me, Google a thousand prisoners freed, Kamala Harris.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you vice president Biden and Senator Harris, your response?",July
Kamala Harris,"That is simply not true and as Attorney General of California where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, I am proud of the work we did. Work that has received national recognition for what has been the important work of reforming a criminal justice system and cleaning up the consequences of the bills that you passed when you were in the United States Senate for decades.",July
Kamala Harris,It was the work of creating one of the first in the nation initiatives around reentering former offenders and getting them jobs and counseling.,July
Jake Tapper,Thank you senator.,July
Kamala Harris,I did the work as Attorney General of putting body cameras-,July
Jake Tapper,Thank you senator.,July
Kamala Harris,On special agents  in the state of California and I’m proud of that work.,July
Jake Tapper,"I want to bring in Congresswoman Gabbard, Congresswoman Gabbard, you took issue with Senator Harris confronting Vice President Biden at the last debate. You called it a, quote, false accusation that Joe Biden is a racist. What’s your response?",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system, that is disproportionately negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today.",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"Oh, Senator Harris says she’s proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she’ll be a prosecutor president. But I’m deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.",July
Tulsi Gabbard,She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California and she fought to keep  cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.,July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you Congresswoman, Senator Harris, your response?",July
Kamala Harris,"As the elected Attorney General of California, I did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people, which became a national model for the work that needs to be done. And I am proud of that work and I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor, but actually doing the work of being in the position to use the power that I had to reform a system that is badly in need of reform.",July
Kamala Harris,That is why we created initiatives that were about reentering former offenders and getting them counseling.,July
Jake Tapper,Thank you.,July
Kamala Harris,It is why and because I know that criminal justice system is so broken-,July
Jake Tapper,Thank you senator.,July
Kamala Harris,That I am an advocate for what  we need to do to not only  but legalize marijuana in the United States.,July
Jake Tapper,"I want to bring a congresswoman Gabbard back in, your response?",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these people’s lives, you did not. And worse yet in the case of those who were on death row, innocent people, you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so. There is no excuse for that. And the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor, you owe them an apology.",July

Speaker 1,"Thank you Senator, I want to talk about that with Senator  includes the guarantee of a job with medical leave, paid vacations and retirement security for everyone in America. Explain how that’s realistic?",July
Kristen Gillibr,"So the first thing that I’m going to do when I’m president is I’m going to Clorox the Oval Office. The second thing I’m going to do, is I will reengage on global climate change, and I will not only sign the Paris global climate accords, but I will lead a worldwide conversation about the urgency of this crisis.",July
Kristen Gillibr,"The greatest threat to humanity is global climate change. I visited a family in Iowa who water spewed into her home, Fran Par, it tossed her refrigerator upend, all the furniture was broken, all the dishes were broken and mud was everywhere. That is the impact of severe weather right now on families lives.",July
Kristen Gillibr,"And so the truth is we need a robust solution. When John F. Kennedy said, “I want to put a man on the moon in the next 10 years, not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard.” He knew it was going to be a measure of our innovation, our success, our ability to galvanize worldwide competition. He wanted to have a space race with Russia. Why not have a green energy race with China? Why not have clean air and clean water for all Americans? Why not rebuild our infrastructure? Why not actually invest in the green jobs? That’s what the Green New Deal is about.",July
Speaker 1,Thank you.,July
Kristen Gillibr,"Not only will I pass it, but I will put a price on carbon to make market forces help us.",July
Speaker 1,"Thank you Senator. Congresswoman Gabbard, you are not a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. Please respond.",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"Oh, first of all, this is personal. You can imagine, I grew up in Hawaii, which is the most remote island chain in the world. So for us growing up there, protecting our environment was not a political issue., it’s a way of life. It’s part of our culture. It’s part of who we are. This is why as a member of congress long before there was ever a Green New Deal, I introduced the most ambitious climate change legislation ever in Congress called the Off Fossil Fuels Act. That actually laid out an actionable plan to take us from where we are today, to transition off of fossil fuels and invest in green renewable energy. Invest in workforce training, invest in the kinds of infrastructure that we need to deal with the problems and the challenges that climate is posing to us today.",July
Speaker 1,"Thank you, Congresswoman. Senator Booker, what’s your response? Is the job guarantee in the Green New Deal realistic?",July
Cory Booker,"I just want to take, first of all, a step back and say that I agree wholeheartedly with Governor Inslee, and it’s one of the reasons why Greenpeace ranks me and him at the top of this entire field  I want to say very clearly, thank you man, thank you. I’ll try harder. Look, the reason why is because first of all, this problem didn’t start yesterday. Science didn’t become a reality yesterday. This has been going on for years. There was another president that would not join an international accord. Then it was the Kyoto accord. I was mayor then and I stood up in national leadership, joining with other mayors to say climate change is not a separate issue.",July
Cory Booker,"It must be the issue and the lens with which you view every issue. Nobody should get applause for rejoining the Paris climate accords, that is kindergarten. We have to go to far advance and makes sure that everything from our trade deals, everything from the billions of dollars we spend to foreign aid, everything must be sublimated to the challenge and the crisis that is existential, which is dealing with the climate threat. And yes, the majority of this problem is outside the United States, but the only way we’re going to deal with this-",July
Speaker 1,Thank you.,July
Cory Booker,Is that the United States leads.,July
Kamala Harris,"Thank you senator, Mayor de Blasio, your administration has come under fire after hundreds of children living in New York City public housing tested positive for elevated levels of lead. As you know, we’re not far from Flint, Michigan, where residents are still dealing with the consequences of having lead in their drinking water. How can you assure the people of Flint and across the nation that you are the right person to handle such a problem?",July
Bill de Blasio,"We have a huge problem and it’s decades old in New York, but here’s what we’ve done about it. We’ve declared the eradication of all lead, literally ending the notion of lead poisoning once and for all as the goal of our administration, and we’re doing something about it. Lead poisoning has gone down 90% since 2005 and we’re going to literally bring it down to zero, because we’re going to go into every place, buildings, schools, public housing, and take out that lead, remediate that lead once and for all, and that needs to be done all over this country. Now, the federal government used to not take any responsibility for-",July
Bill de Blasio,"… country. Now, the federal government used to not take any responsibility for our public housing. For decades they’ve been disinvesting in the public housing that was supposed to be a federal responsibility. That’s part of why we have this lead crisis to begin with. But I’ll tell you what you do when you’re actually in charge of something. I’m in charge of the largest city in this nation. You do not accept the status quo, you fix it. And so we are going into every one of those apartments to make sure those children and those families are safe, and then we are going to eradicate that lead once and for all. And there should be a federal mandate to do the same for Flint, for Detroit, for every place in this country. It can be done.",July
Moderator,"Thank you, Mister Mayor. Secretary Castro, why are you the right candidate to solve this problem? Please respond.",July
Julian Castro,"Well, because people don’t have to wonder what I would do. I’ve actually done it. I was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development when Flint had its water crisis. I went to Flint. We did what we could to help folks get water filters. And then we didn’t stop there. We improved the standard of how we deal with elevated blood lead levels in children. A lot of Americans don’t know that this is still a major problem out there. I was back in Flint about six weeks ago, and I released a plan to invest $50 billion so that we remove lead as a major public health threat. We need to do it, we can do it, and I will do it.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Secretary Castro.",July
Speaker 2,May I get in this?,July
Jake Tapper,"Donald Trump won independents here in Michigan by 16 percentage points, which was critical to Donald Trump winning the state’s 16 electoral votes. Now there is a big debate within the Democratic Party here and around the country about the best way the Democrats can win back Michigan. Vice President Biden, last night on this stage, Senator Elizabeth Warren said, quote, “We’re not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness. We’re going to solve them by being the Democratic Party of big structural change.” What do you say to progressives who worry that your proposals are not ambitious enough to energize the progressive wing of your party, which you will need to beat Donald Trump?",July
Joe Biden,"Because we did it. I was asked to manage an $87 billion plan, to be spent in a total of 18 months, that revived this state and many others, and it kept us out of a depression, with two-tenths of 1% of waste or fraud. Secondly, I was part of the organization within our administration that pushed bailing General Motors out, saving tens of thousands of jobs here in this state. Number three. Number three, I also was asked, as the Mayor of Detroit can tell you, by the president of the United States to help Detroit get out of bankruptcy and get back on its feet. I spent better part of two years out here working to make sure that it did exactly that. We invested significantly in this city, in transportation. Anyway, the point is, we’ve made significant investments in this state. I expect in this city, I expect that’s why the mayor endorsed me.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Vice President Biden. Senator Gillibrand, what’s your response?",July
Kirsten G.,"To the people of Michigan, I know exactly how I’d beat President Trump. I’ve already done it. I took a bus tour to talk about Trump’s broken promises here in Michigan. He promised no bad trade deals. Not only did he not have bad trade deals, he started a trade war with China, and he just signed onto another bad trade agreement with NAFTA 2.0, a giveaway to drug companies in Mexico. I took the bus to Michigan, to Ohio, and to Pennsylvania, telling people that he has broken his promises to them. I lifted up their voices, I listened to their concerns, and I offered real solutions. And I’ve done this before. My first House district I ran in was a two-to-one Republican district. I won it twice, and I haven’t lost an election since. So I can bring people together in red, purple, and blue areas. But more than that, I can get things done.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you. Thank you, Senator Gillibrand. Mr. Yang, in poll after poll, Democratic voters say that having a nominee who can beat President Trump is more important to them than having a nominee who agrees with them on major issues. And right now, according to polls, they say the candidate who has the best chance of doing that, of beating President Trump, is Vice President Biden. Why are they wrong?",July
Andrew Yang,"Well, I’m building a coalition of disaffected Trump voters, independents, libertarians, and conservatives, as well as Democrats and progressives. I believe I’m the candidate best suited to beat Donald Trump. And as for how to win in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania, the problem is that so many people feel like the economy has left them behind. What we have to do is we have to say look, there is record high GDP and stock market prices. You know what else are at record highs? Suicides, drug overdoses, depression, anxiety. It’s gotten so bad that American life expectancy has declined for the last three years.",July
Andrew Yang,"And I like to talk about my wife who’s at home with our two boys right now, one of whom is autistic. What does her work count at in today’s economy? Zero, and we know that’s the opposite of the truth. We know that her work is among the most challenging and vital. The way we win this election is we redefine economic progress to include all the things that matter to the people in Michigan and all of us, like our own health, our well-being, our mental health, our clean air and clean water, how our kids are doing. If we change the measurements for the 21st century economy to revolve around our own well-being, then we will win this election.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"Donald Trump won this election because far too many people in this country felt like they’ve been left behind by both political parties, by self-serving politicians on both sides who are more interested in partisan politics than they are in actually fighting for the people. I’m speaking the truth to people all across this country about the fact that people in Flint, Michigan are still being left behind, still being poisoned by the water in their system. Because every single month we are spending $4 billion on a continuing war in Afghanistan, $4 billion every single month, rather than ending that war, bringing our troops home, and using those precious resources into serving the needs of the people here in this country, people and communities like Flint. That’s the kind of leadership that I’ll bring.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Congresswoman. Senator Booker, your response?",July
Cory Booker,"I’m grateful. I’m grateful. Jake, look, this is one of those times where we’re not staring at the truth and calling it out, and this is a case for the Democratic Party, the truth will set us free. We lost the State of Michigan, because everybody from Republicans to Russians were targeting the suppression of African American voters. We need to say that. If the African American vote in this state had been like it was four years earlier, we would have won the State of Michigan. We need to have a campaign that is ready for what’s coming, an all-out assault, especially on the most valuable voter group in our, in fact, the highest-performing voter group in our coalition, which is black women. And so I will be a person that tries to fight against voter suppression, that can activate and engage the kind of voters and coalitions that are going to win states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.",July
Jake Tapper,Thank you. Senator Harris?,July
Kamala Harris,"First of all, Donald Trump came in making a whole lot of promises to working people that he did not keep. He said he was going to help farmers. He said he was going to help auto workers. Farmers are now looking at bankruptcy, soybeans rotting in bales. Auto workers, we expect perhaps hundreds of thousands will be out of jobs by the end of the year. Jerome Powell just dropped the interest rates, and he admitted why, because of this so-called trade policy that this president has that has been nothing more than the Trump trade tax that has resulted in American families spending as much as $1.4 billion more a month on everything from shampoo to washing machines. He betrayed the American people, he betrayed American families, and he will lose this election, because folks are clear that he has done nothing except try to beat people down instead of lift people up. And that’s what we want in the next president of the United States.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Senator Harris. The debate is back right…",July
Dana Bash,"And we’re back with the CNN Democratic Presidential Debate. We want to turn now to the economy. Secretary Castro, this was for you. Rising unemployment is near historic lows, including for Latinos and African Americans. You have all outlined plans, but you in particular, that could end up raising taxes. How can you guarantee that won’t hurt the economy?",July
Julian Castro,"Well, first of all, there are a lot of Americans right now that are hurting. Just go and ask the folks that just received notice that they’re going to get been laid off by General Motors. Or ask the many folks who are sleeping on the streets in big cities and small towns across the United States. Or ask fast food workers that I joined a couple of weeks ago that are working for minimum wage and can’t provide for their families or pay the rent. So the idea that America is doing just fine is wrong. Not only that, this president always likes to take credit like he did this. We’ve now had about 105 straight months of positive job growth, the longest streak in American history. Over 80 months of that was due to President Barack Obama. Thank you, Barack Obama. Thank you, Barack Obama. So I believe that we need to invest in what will ensure that Americans can prosper in the years to come. Making sure they have the knowledge and skills to compete in the 21st century economy. Ensuring that they can afford the rent where they live and that they have health care so that they don’t have to worry about going homeless because they can’t afford a medical procedure.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Secretary Castro. I want to turn now to a question about trade and, for Congresswoman Gabbard, many saw the Trans-Pacific Partnership issue as something that would be a critical tool to deal with the rise of China. You were against it. How would you ensure that the United States is able to remain competitive against China on the world stage.",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"By pushing for fair trade. Not trade deals that give away the sovereignty of the American people and our country, that give away American jobs, and that threaten our environment. These were the three main issues with that massive trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I think the central one was the fact that it gave away our sovereignty to a panel of international corporations whose rulings would supersede any domestic law that we would pass, either a federal law or a state or a local law. This is extremely dangerous and goes against the very values that we have as a country. What to speak of the fact that it would have a negative impact on domestic jobs and that it lacked clear protections for our environment. These are the things that we have to keep at the forefront as we look to enact fair trade deals with other countries to make sure that we continue to be a thriving part of our global economy.",July
Dana Bash,"So to be clear, congresswoman, would you keep President Trump’s tariffs on China in place?",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"I would not, because the approach that President Trump has taken has been extremely volatile without any clear strategic plan and it has a ravaging and devastating effect on our domestic manufacturers, on our farmers, who are already struggling and now failing to see the light of day because of the plan that Trump has taken.",July
Dana Bash,"Vice President Biden, would you read join the Trans-Pacific Partnership which, of course, President Trump withdrew from? Please respond.",July
Joe Biden,"I’d renegotiate it. We make up 25% of the world’s economy. In order… Either China’s going to write the rules of the road for the 21st century on trade or we are. We have to join with the 40% of the world that we had with us, and this time makes sure that there’s no one sitting at that table doing the deal unless environmentalists are there and labor is there. And to make sure we equip our workers first to compete by investing in them now, in the things that make them more competitive. That’s what we have to do. Otherwise they are going to write the rules of the road. We must have the rest of the world join us to keep them-",July
Dana Bash,Thank you.,July
Joe Biden,… In check from abusing it.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you. Vice President Biden, just to be clear, would you or would you not rejoin the TTP? Yes or no?",July
Joe Biden,I would not rejoin the TTP as it was initially put forward. I would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the Pacific nations that we had in South America and North America so that we could bring them together to hold China accountable for the rules of us setting the rules of the road as to how trade should be conducted. Otherwise they’re going to do exactly what they’re doing. Fill the vacuum and run the table.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, sir. Mayor de Blasio, you also oppose the deal. Please respond.",July
Bill de Blasio,"Yeah. And I would just want to ask this question of all the candidates, but particularly of Vice President Biden. President Trump is trying to sell NAFTA 2.0. He’s got a new name for it. It’s just as dangerous as the old NAFTA. It’s going to take away American jobs like the old NAFTA, like it did to Michigan. And we cannot have Democrats be party to a new NAFTA. So Vice President, I believe you’re the only person on the stage who voted for the original NAFTA. Are you ready to say here and now that you will oppose a new NAFTA? And that what you will believe in, which a lot of us hope for, is trade treaties that empower organized labor across the boundaries of the world and give working people power again, not just multinational corporations.",July
Dana Bash,Mr. Vice President?,July
Joe Biden,Yes.,July
Dana Bash,"Your response? Your response, sir?",July
Joe Biden,Yes.,July
Dana Bash,That’s it?,July
Joe Biden,"No, he said would I insist that labor be engaged? The answer is yes.",July
Bill de Blasio,I consider that a victory.,July
Joe Biden,"Well, I love your affection for me. You spend a lot of time with me.",July
Bill de Blasio,"You know what? We believe in redemption, Joe. We believe in redemption in this party.",July
Joe Biden,"Well, I tell you what. I hope you’re part of it.",July
Dana Bash,"Okay. I want to ask a question of Senator Bennett now. Senator, CNN reached out to Michigan Democratic Primary voters for their most pressing question. Ferris from Flint, Michigan has this question, “Here in Detroit our economy has seen firsthand how technology and automation can displace workers and create uncertainty around human job security. How would you balance these disruptions created by technology with the beneficial impact of technology on our economy?”",July
Michael Bennet,"Dana this goes to the last question you asked as well, which is how are we going to remain competitive? It’s not just about trade, which we were talking about earlier. It’s about whether we’re going to invest in this country anymore. Since 2001 we have cut five trillion dollars worth of taxes. Almost all of that has gone to the wealthiest people in America. We have made the income inequality worse, not better, through the policies of the federal government. We’ve spent 5.6 trillion dollars in the Middle East. That’s 12 or 13 trillion dollars that, from the point of view of driving the economy in Michigan or anywhere else in America, we might as well just have lit that money on fire. We’ve got to stop doing that. And we need to invest in America again. For the money that we’ve spent, that I just described, we could have fixed every road and bridge in this country. We could have fixed every airport that needs to be fixed. We could have fixed, not just Flint, but every-",July
Dana Bash,Thank you.,July
Michael Bennet,… Water system in this country. We could’ve made social security solvent for my children.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator.",July
Michael Bennet,But we did none of it because of self-serving politicians in Washington DC who voted for deals that were good for them.,July
Dana Bash,"Senator Bennett, thank you very much.",July
Michael Bennet,But not for Michigan or the American people.,July
Dana Bash,"Your time is up, sir. Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang women, on average, earn 80 cents, about 80 cents, for every dollar earned by men. Senator Harris wants to fine companies that don’t close their gender pay gaps. As an entrepreneur, do you think a stiff fine will change how companies pay their female employees?",July
Andrew Yang,"I have seen firsthand the inequities in the business world where women are concerned, particularly in startups and entrepreneurship. We have to do more at every step. And, if you are a woman entrepreneur, the obstacles start not just at home. But then when you seek a mentor or an investor often they don’t look like you and they might not think your idea is the right one. In order to give women a leg up, what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation, including the ones who are in exploitative and abusive jobs and relationships around the country. I’m talking about the waitress who’s getting harassed by her boss at the diner, who might have a business idea, but right now is stuck where she is. What we have to do is we have to give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses. And the best way to do this is by putting a dividend of $1,000 a month into their hands. It would be a game changer for women around the country because we know that women do more of the unrecognized and uncompensated work in our society. It will not change unless we change it. And I say that’s just what we do.",July
Dana Bash,"Senator Harris, your response.",July
Kamala Harris,"I think that supported my proposal, which is this, since 1963 when we passed the Equal Pay Act we have been talking about the fact women are not paid equally for equal work. Fast forward to the Year of our Lord 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar. Black women, 61 cents. Native American woman, 58 cents. Latinas, 53 cents. I’m done with the conversation. So, yes, I am proposing in order to deal with this, one, I’m going to require corporations to post on their website whether they are paying women equally for equal work. Two, they will be fined. For every 1% differential between what they’re paying men and women they will be find 1% of their previous year’s profits. That’ll get everybody’s attention.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, senator. Senator-",July
Kamala Harris,Time for action.,July
Dana Bash,"Senator Gillibrand, what’s your response? Will fining companies help solve the problem?",July
Gillibrand,"I think we have to have a broader conversation about whether we value women and whether we want to make sure women have every opportunity in the workplace. And I want to address Vice President Biden directly. When the Senate was debating middle-class affordability for childcare, he wrote an Op-ed. He voted against it, the only vote. But what he wrote an Op-ed was that he believed that women working outside the home would, “Create the deterioration of family.” He also said that women who were working outside the home were, “Avoiding responsibility.” And I just need to understand, as a woman who’s worked my entire career as the primary-wage earner, as the primary caregiver… In fact, my second son Henry is here and I had him when I was a member of Congress. So, under Vice President Biden’s analysis, am I serving in Congress resulting in the deterioration of the family because I had access to quality, affordable daycare? I just want to know what he meant when he said that.",July
Joe Biden,"That was a long time ago and here’s what it was about. It would have given people making today $100,000 a year a tax break for childcare. I did not want that. I wanted the childcare to go to people making less than $100,000 and that’s what it was about. As a single father, who in fact raised three children for five years by myself, I have some idea what it costs. I support making sure that every single, solitary person needing child care get an $8,000 tax credit. Now, that would put 700,000 women back to work, increase the GDP by almost eight-tenths of 1%. It’s the right thing to do. If we can give tax breaks to corporations for these things, why can’t we do it this way?",July
Dana Bash,Thank you.,July
Gillibrand,"But, Mr. Vice President, you didn’t answer my question. What did you mean when you said when a woman works outside the home, it’s resulting in, “The deterioration of family.”",July
Joe Biden,No. What I-,July
Gillibrand,And that we are avoiding… These are quotes. It was the title of the Op-ed.,July
Joe Biden,No.,July
Gillibrand,And that just causes concern for me. Because we know America’s women are working. Four out of 10 moms have to work. They are the primary or sole wage earners. They actually have to put food on the table. Eight out of 10 moms are working today. Most women have to work to provide for their kids. Many women want to be working to provide for their communities and to help people.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator. Let the Vice President respond now, thank you.",July
Gillibrand,Either you don’t believe it today or what did you mean when you said it then?,July
Joe Biden,"In the very beginning my deceased wife worked when we had children. My present wife has worked all the way through raising our children. The fact of the matter is the situation is one that I don’t know what’s happened. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. Lilly Ledbetter, I was deeply involved in making sure there’s the equal pay amendments. I was deeply involved in all these things. I came up with the It’s On Us proposal to see to it the women were treated more decently on college campuses. You came to Syracuse University with me and said it was wonderful. I’m passionate about the concern, making sure women are treated equally. I don’t know what’s happened except that you’re now running for president.",July
Gillibrand,"So I understand… Mr. Vice President? Mr. Vice President, I respect you deeply. I respect you deeply. But those words are very specific. You said women working outside the home would lead to the deterioration of family. My grandmother worked outside the home.",July
Joe Biden,So did-,July
Gillibrand,My mother worked outside the home.,July
Joe Biden,That’s-,July
Gillibrand,And for-,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator Gillibrand.",July
Gillibrand,Well he hasn’t… Either-,July
Dana Bash,I want to bring Senator Harris into this conversation.,July
Gillibrand,"Either he no longer believes it. I mean, I just think he needs to-",July
Joe Biden,I never believed it.,July
Gillibrand,Okay.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you. Senator Harris, please respond.",July
Kamala Harris,"Well, I just… Listen, I mean, talk about now running for president and you change your position. On the Hyde Amendment, Vice President, where you made a decision for years to withhold resources to poor women to have access to reproductive healthcare and including women who were the victims of rape and incest. Do you now say that you have evolved and you regret that? Because you’ve only, since you’ve been running for president this time, said that you in some way would take that back or you didn’t agree with the decision that you made over many, many years.",July
Joe Biden,I’m getting to-,July
Kamala Harris,"And this directly impacted so many women in our country. And I personally prosecuted rape cases and child molestation cases. And the experience that those women have, those children have, and that they would then be denied the resources-",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you, Senator. Let the Vice President respond to it.",July
Kamala Harris,I think is unacceptable.,July
Joe Biden,"The fact is that the Senator knows that’s not my position. Everybody on this stage who’s been in the Congress and the Senate or House has voted for the Hyde Amendment at some point. The Hyde Amendment, in the past, was available because there was other access for those kinds of services provided privately. But once I wrote the legislation making sure that every single woman would in fact have an opportunity to have health care paid for by the federal government, everyone, that that could no longer stand. I support a woman’s right to choose. I support it. It’s a constitutional right. I’ve supported it and I will continue to support it. And I will, in fact, move as president to see to that the congress legislates that that is the law as well.",July
Dana Bash,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Governor Inslee, your response?",July
Kamala Harris,"Well, why did it take you so long to change your position on the Hyde Amendment? Why did it take so long until you were running for president to change your position on the Hyde Amendment?",July
Joe Biden,Because there was not full federal funding for all reproductive services prior to this point.,July
Kamala Harris,Okay.,July
Dana Bash,"Thank you. Governor Inslee, your response?",July
Jay Inslee,"I would suggest that we need to broaden our discussion. I would suggest we need to think about a bigger scandal in America, which is that in professions and careers where women have been more than the majority, they have been almost always underpaid. And that is why this year I’m proud to be the governor who won the largest pay increase for our educators in the United States. And I believe that that is long, long overdue. I think it is true for nursing staff, as well. And I’m glad that we’ve now passed new measures.",July
Jake Tapper,Thank you.,July
Jay Inslee,And I’m glad that we’ve increased our union membership 10%.,July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Governor.",July
Jay Inslee,So unions can stand up for women as well.,July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, Governor Inslee. I want to turn to foreign policy, if we can. Senator Booker, there are about 14,000 US service members in Afghanistan right now. If elected, will they still be in Afghanistan by the end of your first year in office?",July
Cory Booker,"Well, first of all, I want to say very clearly that I will not do foreign policy by tweet as Donald Trump seems to do all the time. A guy that literally tweets out that we’re pulling our troops out before his generals even know about it, is creating a dangerous situation for our troops in places like Afghanistan. And so I will bring our troops home and I will bring them home as quickly as possible. But I will not set, during a campaign, an artificial deadline. I will make sure we do it, we do it expeditiously. We do it safely to not create a vacuum that’s ultimately going to destabilize the Middle East and, perhaps, create the environment for terrorism and for extremism to threaten our nation.",July
Jake Tapper,"Congresswoman Gabbard, you’re the only veteran on the stage. Please respond.",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"This is real in a way that’s very difficult to convey in words. I was deployed to Iraq in 2005, during the height of the war, where I served in a field medical unit where every single day I saw the high cost of war. Just this past week, two more of our soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. My cousin is deployed to Afghanistan right now. Nearly 300 of our Hawaii National Guard soldiers are deployed to Afghanistan. 14,000 service members are deployed there. This is not about arbitrary deadlines. This is about leadership. The leadership I will bring to do the right thing, to bring our troops home within the first year in office. Because they shouldn’t have been there this long. For too long we’ve had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence, the toll that it takes on our service members, on their families. We have to do the right thing, end these wasteful regime-change wars, and bring our troops home.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you. Thank you, congresswoman. Mr. Yang, Iran has now breached the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, after President Trump withdrew the US from the deal. And that puts Iran closer to building a nuclear weapon, the ability to do so at the very least. You’ve said, if Iran violates the agreement, the US would need to respond, “Very strongly.” So how would a President Yang respond right now?",July
Andrew Yang,"I would move to deescalate tensions in Iran, because they’re responding to the fact that we’ve pulled out of this agreement. And it wasn’t just us and Iran, there were many other world powers that were part of that multilateral agreement. We’d have to try and reenter that agreement, renegotiate the timelines, because the timelines now don’t make as much sense. But I’ve signed a pledge to end the forever wars. Right now our strength abroad reflects our strength at home. What’s happened, really? We’ve fallen apart at home so we elected Donald Trump and now we have this erratic and unpredictable relationship with even our longstanding partners and allies. What we have to do is we have to start investing those resources to solve the problem right here at home. We’ve spent trillions of dollars and lost thousands of American lives in conflicts that had unclear benefits. We’ve been in a constant state of war for 18 years. This is not what the American people want. I would bring the troops home. I would deescalate tensions with Iran. And I would start investing our resources in our own communities.",July
Jake Tapper,"Governor Inslee, your response?",July
Jay Inslee,"Well, I think that these are matters of great and often difficult judgment and there is no sort of primer for presidents to read. We have to determine whether a potential president has adequate judgment in these decisions. I was only one of two members on this panel today who were called to make a judgment about the Iraq war. I was a relatively new member of Congress and I made the right judgment, because it was obvious to me that George Bush was fanning the flames of war. Now we face similar situations where we recognize we have a president who’d be willing to beat the drums of war. We need a president who can stand up against the drums of war and make rational decisions. That was the right vote and I believe it.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you. Thank you, Governor. Vice President Biden, he was obviously suggesting that you made the wrong decision and had bad judgment when you voted to go to war in Iraq as a US senator.",July
Joe Biden,"I did make a bad judgment trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the UN to agree to put inspectors in. From the moment Shock and Awe started, from that moment, I was opposed to the effort and I was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the congress and the administration. Secondly, I was asked by the president in the first meeting we had on Iraq. He turned and said, “Joe, get our combat troops out.” In front of the entire national security team. One of the proudest moments of my life was to stand there in Al-Faw Palace and tell everyone that we’re coming, all our combat troops are coming, home.",July
Jake Tapper,Thank you.,July
Joe Biden,"I opposed the surge in Afghanistan. This is long overdue. We should have not, in fact, gone into Afghanistan.",July
Jake Tapper,Thank you.,July
Joe Biden,… The way.,July
Bill de Blasio,Mr. Vice President.,July
Joe Biden,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I want to bring in…",July
Joe Biden,"I would like to bring in the person on the stage who served in Iraq. Governor, I’m sorry, Congresswoman Gabbard, your response to what Vice President Biden just said?",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"We were all lied to. This is the betrayal. This is the betrayal to the American people, to me, to my fellow service members. We were all lied to, told that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, was working with Al-Qaeda, and that this posed a threat to the American people. So I enlisted after 9/11 to protect our country. To go after those who attacked us on that fateful day, who took the lives of thousands of Americans. The problem is that this current president is continuing to betray us. We were supposed to be going after Al-Qaeda. But over years now not only have we not gone after Al-Qaeda, who is stronger today than they were in 9/11, our president is supporting Al-Qaeda.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, congresswoman.",July
Bill de Blasio,We still didn’t talk about Iran.,July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, please.",July
Bill de Blasio,We didn’t talk about Iran.,July
Jake Tapper,Please.,July
Bill de Blasio,Because we’re on the march to war in Iran right now and we blew by it.,July
Jake Tapper,"Please, mayor, the rules. Please follow the rules.",July
Bill de Blasio,I respect the rules.,July
Jake Tapper,Mayor.,July
Bill de Blasio,But we-,July
Jake Tapper,Mayor.,July
Bill de Blasio,Have to stop this-,July
Jake Tapper,"Mayor, thank you very much.",July
Bill de Blasio,… March to war in Iran.,July
Jake Tapper,We’re going on and we’re going to talk about another subject.,July
Bill de Blasio,And the Democratic party has to stand up for it.,July
Jake Tapper,"Mayor, thank you very much. I appreciate that. Let’s talk about now the former special counsel Robert Mueller’s appearance in front of congress last week. When asked whether or not the president could be charged with a crime after leaving office, his answer was yes. Senator Harris, you’ve criticized President Trump for interfering with the justice department. And, just last month, you said if you were elected president your Justice Department would, “Have no choice and should go forward with obstruction of justice charges against Former President Trump.” Why is it okay for you to advocate for the Justice Department to prosecute somebody but, President Trump, not him?",July
Kamala Harris,"Well, I would never direct the Department of Justice to do whatever it believes it should do. But listen, look, we all watched his testimony. I read the report. There are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president and he needs to be held accountable. I’ve seen people go to prison for far less. And the reality of it is that we have a person in the White House right now who has been shielded by a memo in the United States Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be indicted. I believe the American people are right to say there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law, including the President of the United States,",July
Jake Tapper,"Senator Booker, your response?",July
Cory Booker,"My response is exactly that. I’ve read the report, I’ve read the redacted versions of the report. We have something that is astonishing going on the United States of America. We have a president that is not acting like the leader of the free world. He’s acting like an authoritarian against the actual Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold. And so this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage. I believe that we, in the United States Congress, should start impeachment proceedings immediately. And I’ll tell you this, Debbie Stabenow has joined my call for starting impeachment proceedings. Because he is now stonewalling congress, not allowing or subjecting himself to the checks and balances. We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. The politics of this be damned. When we look back in history at what happened when a President of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world, the question is what will we have done? And I believe the congress should do its job.",July
Jake Tapper,"Senator Booker, thank you very much. Secretary Castro, what’s your response?",July
Julian Castro,"Well, I agree. I was the first of the candidates to call on congress to begin impeachment proceedings. There are 10 different instances that Robert Mueller has pointed out where this president either obstructed justice or attempted to obstruct justice. And I believe that they should go forward with impeachment proceedings. As to the question of what my Department of Justice would do, I agree with those who say that a president should not direct an attorney general specifically to prosecute or not prosecute. However, I believe that the evidence is plain and clear and that if it gets that far that you’re likely to see a prosecution of Donald Trump.",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, secretary. Mayor de Blasio, I’m going to bring you in. What’s your response?",July
Bill de Blasio,"I think it’s obvious at this point in our history that the president has committed the crimes worthy of impeachment. But I want to caution my fellow Democrats, while we move in every way we can for impeachment, we have to remember at the same time the American people are out there looking for us to do something for them in their lives. And what they see when they turn on the TV or go online is just talk about impeachment. We need more talk about working people and their lives. For example, are we really ready? And I ask people on this stage this question, are we ready to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes? That’s something every American wants to know about. That’s something they want answers to right now. So yeah, move for impeachment. But don’t forget to do the people’s business and to stand up for working people. Because that’s how we’re actually going to beat Donald Trump. The best impeachment is beating him in the election of 2020.",July
Jake Tapper,"Mayor, thank you very much. Senator Bennett, how do you respond to this conversation?",July
Michael Bennet,"I think, look, as we go forward here we need to recognize a very practical reality which is that we are four months away. We’ve got the August recess, then we are four months away from the Iowa caucuses. And I just want to make sure whatever we do doesn’t end up with an acquittal by Mitch McConnell in the Senate, which it surely would. And then President Trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress. I believe we have a moral obligation to beat Donald Trump. He has to be a single-term president and we can’t do anything that plays into his hands. We were talking earlier about climate up here, it’s so important. Donald Trump should be the last climate denier that’s ever in the White House.",July
Jake Tapper,"Senator Bennet, thank you very much. Secretary Castro, please respond.",July
Michael Bennet,But we need to be smart about how-,July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, senator.",July
Michael Bennet,… We’re running or we’re going to give him a second term.,July
Jake Tapper,"Secretary please, your turn.",July
Michael Bennet,We can’t do it.,July
Julian Castro,"Well, let me first say that I really do believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time. All of us have a vision for the future of the country that we’re articulating to the American people. We’re going to continue to do that. We have an election coming up. At the same time, senator, I think that too many folks in the senate and in the congress had been spooked by 1998. I believe that the times are different. And, in fact, I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment. The Mueller Report clearly details that he deserves it. And what’s going to happen in the Fall of next year, of 2020, if they don’t impeach him it’s easy to say, “You see? You see? The Democrats didn’t go after me on impeachment. And you know why? Because I didn’t do anything wrong. These folks that always investigate me, they’re always trying to go after me. When it came down to it, they didn’t go after me there because I didn’t do anything wrong.” Conversely, if Mitch McConnell is the one that lets him off the hook, we’re going to be able to say-",July
Jake Tapper,Secretary.,July
Julian Castro,"“Well, sure. They impeached him in the house-",July
Jake Tapper,"Secretary Castro, thank you.",July
Julian Castro,"… But his friend, Mitch McConnell, Moscow Mitch-",July
Jake Tapper,"Thank you, secretary.",July
Julian Castro,… Let him off the hook.”,July
Jake Tapper,"Senator Bennet, please respond.",July
Michael Bennet,"I don’t disagree with that, you just said it better than I did. We have to walk and chew gum at the same time. It is incredibly unusual for members of Congress to be able to do that. And I’m glad that Secretary Castro has the ambition-",July
Julian Castro,"Well my brother can, he’s here tonight.",July
Michael Bennet,"That’s what I was going to say, it’s your brother that’s giving you that good feeling about the congress. That’s what we should do.",July
Jake Tapper,Thank you.,July
Jake Tapper,"Welcome back to the CNN the Democratic Presidential Debate. It is time now for closing statements. You will each receive one minute. Mayor de Blasio, let’s begin with you.",July
Mayor de Blasio,"Thank you. For the last three years, we’ve watched Donald Trump pit working people against each other, black versus white, citizen versus immigrant, and why? So that the wealthy and the powerful he represents can hold the American dream hostage from everyone else. We can’t let them get away with it. If we’re going to beat Donald Trump, this has to be a party that stands for something.",July
Mayor de Blasio,"This has to be the party of labor unions. This has to be the party of universal health care. This has to be the party that’s not afraid to say out loud we’re going to tax the hell out of the wealthy. And when we do that, Donald Trump, right on cue will call us socialists. Well, here’s what I’ll say to him, “Donald, you’re the real socialist. The problem is it’s socialism for the rich.”",July
Mayor de Blasio,"We here in this country, we don’t have to take that anymore. We can fight back. If you agree that we can stand up to Donald Trump and we can stand up to the wealthy, then go to taxthehell.com and join us so we can build a country that puts working people first.",July
Jake Tapper,Senator Bennet.,July
Senator Bennet,"Thank you. Thank you very much. What I want to say to all of you tonight is we have been here before as a country. We have faced challenges that we’ve actually even forget some of us tonight how hard the people fought, how hard they work, how hard they organized the votes, they had to take the people they had to get to the polls to make this country more democratic, more fair and more free. And now we have a person in the White House who has no appreciation of that history, who doesn’t believe in the rule of law, who doesn’t believe in the independence of the judiciary, who doesn’t believe that climate change is real.",July
Senator Bennet,"I think that we have an incredible opportunity in front of us, all of us, to come together just as our parents and grandparents did before them and face challenges even harder than the ones that we face. But the only way we’re going to be able to do it is to put the divisive politics of Donald Trump behind us, and the divisive politics of the last 10 years behind us. We need to come together united against a broken Washington, make Donald Trump a one term President, and begin to govern this country again for our kids and our grandkids who cannot do it for themselves.",July
Senator Bennet,We have to do it for them. Please join me at michaelbennet.com thanks for being here tonight.,July
Jake Tapper,Governor Inslee.,July
Jay Inslee,"For decades we have kicked the can down the road on climate change. And now under Donald Trump we faced a looming catastrophe, but it is not too late. We have one last chance. And when you have one chance in life, you take it. Think about this, literally the survival of humanity on this planet in civilization as we know it is in the hands of the next president. And we have to have a leader who will do what is necessary to save us.",July
Jay Inslee,"And that includes making this the top priority of the next Presidency. And I alone on this panel am making a commitment that this will be the organizing principle of my administration, not the first day, but every day. And if you share my view of the urgency of this matter, I hope you’ll join me because we are up against powerful special fossil fuel interests. And it is time to stand up on our legs and confront the fossil fuels special interests because that is our salvation, what it depends upon.",July
Jay Inslee,So I hope you will consider going to jayinslee.com and joining this effort. And I will close with this. I am confident and optimistic tonight even in the face of this difficulty because I know we can build a clean energy economy. I know we can save our children and our grandchildren. I know that we can defeat climate change. And we will defeat Donald Trump. This is our moral responsibility and we will fulfill it. Thank you very much.,July
Jake Tapper,Senator Gillibrand.,July
Gillibrand,"Donald Trump has really torn apart the moral fabric of this country dividing us on every racial line, every religious line, every socioeconomic line he can find. I’m running for president because I want to help people. And I actually have the experience and the ability to do that. I’ve brought Congress together and actually made a difference in people’s lives. I also know how to beat Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to the American people.",July
Gillibrand,"I’ve taken this fight directly to his backyard in Michigan, and Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and I’ll go to all the places in this country. I will fight for your family. Doesn’t matter who you are. It doesn’t matter where you live. It doesn’t matter who you love because that’s my responsibility. And I’ve done this before. I started out in a two to one Republican district. I won it twice. I’ve never lost an election since.",July
Gillibrand,"And I not only bring people together electorally, but also legislatively. I get things done. So we need a president who is not afraid of the big challenges of the big fights. There is no false choice. We don’t need a liberal or progressive with big ideas, or we don’t need a moderate who can win back Trump-Obama voters. You need someone who can do both. And that’s who I am. Please go to kirstengillibrand.com so I can make the next debate stage.",July
Jake Tapper,Congresswoman Gabbard.,July
Tulsi Gabbard,"Thank you. Donald Trump and warmongering politicians in Washington have failed us. They continue to escalate tensions with other nuclear-armed countries like Russia, and China, and North Korea, starting a new Cold War, pushing us closer and closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe. Now as we stand here tonight, there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us. And if we were to get an attack right here tonight, you would have 30 minutes, 30 minutes before we were hit.",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"And you would receive an alert like the one we received in Hawaii last year that would say incoming missile. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. And you would see as we did, as my loved ones in Hawaii did, there is no shelter. This is the warmongers hoax. There is no shelter. It’s all a lie. As president, I will end this insanity because it doesn’t have to be this way.",July
Tulsi Gabbard,"I will end these wasteful regime change wars. Work to end this new Cold War through the use of diplomacy to deescalate these tensions. And take the trillions of dollars that we’ve been wasting on these wars and on these weapons, and redirect those resources into serving the needs of our people right here at home. Things like healthcare for all, making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink and clean air to breathe, investing in education, investing in our infrastructure. The needs are great. As your president, I will put your interests above all else.",July
Jake Tapper,Secretary Castro.,July
Julian Castro,"Well, first of all let me say thank you to you, Jake, Dana, and to Don, and to everybody here, and to those watching. This election is all about what kind of nation we’re going to become. You and I, we stand on the shoulders of folks who have made beds and made sacrifices. People that fought in wars, and fought discrimination, folks that pick crops, and stood in picket lines. And they helped build the wonderful nation that we live in today.",July
Julian Castro,"Donald Trump has not been bashful in his cruelty. And I’m not going to be bashful in my common sense and compassion. I believe that we need leadership that understands that we need to move forward as one nation with one destiny. And our destiny in the years to come is to be the smartest, the healthiest, the fairest, and the most prosperous nation on earth. If you want to help me build that America for the future, I hope you’ll go to juliancastro.com. And on January 20th, 2021 we’ll say together, “Adios,” to Donald Trump.",July
Jake Tapper,Mr. Yang.,July
Andrew Yang,"You know what the talking heads couldn’t stop talking about after the last debate? It’s not the fact that I’m somehow number four on this stage in national polling. It was the fact that I wasn’t wearing a tie. Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan. We’re up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines playing roles in this reality TV show. It’s one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our President.",July
Andrew Yang,"We need to be laser focused on solving the real challenges of today, like the fact that the most common job jobs in America may not exist in a decade. Or, that most Americans cannot pay their bills. My flagship proposal, the Freedom Dividend, would put $1,000 a month into the hands of every American adult, be a game changer for millions of American families. If you care more about your family and your kids than my neckwear, enter your zip code at yang2020.com, and see what $1,000 a month would mean to your community. I have done the math. It’s not left. It’s not right. It’s forward. And that is how we’re going to beat Donald Trump in 2020.",July
Jake Tapper,Senator Booker.,July
Cory Booker,"Thank you. First, I just want to give a lot of thanks to the city of Detroit. They’re hosting us today. And one of the reasons I respect this city is because it has the kind of defiant love that I find in many American cities, including the city of Newark. And Detroit is turning around. And Newark is turning around because we let no one divide us, no one demean or degrade us, or underestimate our worth. We pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause.",July
Cory Booker,"That’s the history of this city. My mom is sitting there who was born in the city of Detroit, born to a guy that was a UAW worker. My grandfather who pulled his family out of poverty in the Depression. My grandmother joined him. She was really entrepreneurial, opened a pool hall and a laundry mat right here in this city. That is the American dream. And so many of us have stories like that. But the dream of this country is under threat right now.",July
Cory Booker,"Well, my mom’s generation, 80, 95% of baby boomers did better than their parents. It’s now just a coin toss for millennials. We have a real crises in our country. And the crises is Donald Trump, but not only Donald Trump. I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump. Well, that is the floor, and not the ceiling.",July
Cory Booker,"The way we beat Donald Trump is not just focusing on him. He wants to take all the oxygen out of the room. It’s when we start focusing on each other, and understanding that our common bonds, and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before. It’s what’s gonna save us now. That is the kind of leader that I am going to be as President of the United States. Not just uniting the Democratic Party, but making sure that we put more indivisible back into this one nation under God. And if you believe like I do, please go to corybooker.com and join the mission.",July
Jake Tapper,Senator Harris.,July
Kamala Harris,"So in my background as Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks who preyed on the homeowners, many of whom lost their homes and will never be able to buy another. I’ve taken on the for profit colleges who preyed on students, put them out of business. I’ve preyed on transnational criminal organizations that have preyed on women and children. And I will tell you, we have a predator living in the White House.",July
Kamala Harris,"And I’m going to tell you something. Donald Trump has predatory nature and predatory instincts. And the thing about predators is this, by their very nature, they prey on people they perceive to be weak. They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable. They prey on people who are in need of help, often desperate for help. And predators are cowards.

Kamala Harris,"And let me tell you, we’ve got a long rap sheet. We’re looking at someone who passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country when he said he would help working families.

We have someone who passed his so-called trade policy that was trade policy by tweet and has resulted in a tax on American families.",July

Joe Biden,"Thank you. Thank you very much. And thank you Mr. Mayor for Detroit hosting this. Look, I’ve said it many times and I think everyone agrees with this. We’re in a battle for the soul of America. This is the most consequential election any one of you no matter how old or young you are has ever, ever participate in. Four more years of Donald Trump will go down as an aberration. Hard to overcome the damage he’s done, but we can overcome it.",July
Joe Biden,"Eight more years of Donald Trump will change America in a fundamental way. The America we know will no longer exist. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let them know who we are. We choose science over fiction. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. And we choose. We choose the idea that we can as Americans, when we act together, do anything. This is the United States of America. We’ve acted together. We have never, never, never been unable to overcome whatever the problem was. If you agree with me, go to Joe30330 and help me in this fight. Thank you very much.",July

George S,"Good evening, and welcome to Houston. We are live from Texas Southern University for tonight’s Democratic debate. The top 10 candidates are here. It’s going to start right now, and on the stage, you see them. They have all met the criteria set by the Democratic National Committee. At least 10 others have not met the threshold, so for the first time in this primary, a single debate in a single night, with all the top candidates facing off. It is a critical test for candidates, and their campaigns, at a critical time for our country. They’re going to lay out their vision for the country, their records, their differences with President Trump, and each other. We’re going to do our best to bring you a lively, informative, and civil debate. I’m joined here tonight by my ABC colleague, World News Tonight anchor David Muir, our national correspondent, Linsey Davis, and Jorge Ramos from our partner network, Univision. Jorge?",Sept
Jorge Ramos,"George, thank you very much. We appreciate the opportunity to welcome Latinos across the country, and to ask about Latinx issues during these challenging times. .

Candidates will have one minute, fifteen seconds to answer a direct question, and forty five seconds for a rebuttal or response, as directed by one of the moderators. Candidates will each see green and yellow lights, there. You see them right there, indicating how much time they have remaining. When time is up, the light will turn red. Candidates who interrupt will be subject to having their time reduced later on. This is democracy, the great American experiment, and the candidates are here tonight to make their case.",Sept

Julian Castro,"01 PM, we’re going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate. There will be life after Donald Trump. The truth is that our problems didn’t start just with Donald Trump, and we won’t solve them by embracing old ideas. We need a bold vision. Universal pre-K and universal health care. Unleashing millions of new jobs in the clean energy economy. A tax system that rewards people who have to work for a living.",Sept

Florida, Georgia, and Arizona, and finally turn Texas blue, and say goodbye to Donald Trump.",Sept
George S,Senator Klobuchar.,Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"Good evening, Texas Southern. I believe that what unites us up here, the ten of us, is much stronger than what divides us, and I think that’s true of our country, too. Now, I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we’ve already got that in the White House. Houston, we have a problem. We have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show. He would rather lie than lead. I think we need something different. I am someone that tells the truth. I don’t make promises that I can’t keep. I have people’s back, and I believe that to win, you bring people with you, and that is how you govern, as well. You’re going to hear a lot of ideas up here. Some will be great, but if you see that some of them seem a little off track, I’ve got a better way. If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics, and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you’ve got a home with me. Because I don’t want to be the president for half of America. I want to be the president for all of America.",Sept
George S,Congressman Beto O’Rourke.,Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"It’s an honor to be on this debate stage. It is wonderful to be back in Texas, in Houston, back here at TSU. On August 3rd in El Paso, Texas, two things became crystal clear for me, and I think produced a turning point for this country. The first is just how dangerous Donald Trump is. The cost and the consequence of his presidency. Racism and violence that had long had been a part of America was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso, Texas. Where 22 people were killed, dozens more grievously injured, by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place. Inspired to kill by our president.",Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"The second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now. The bitterness, the pettiness, the smallness of the moment, the incentives to attack one another, and try to make differences without distinctions. Mountains out of molehills. We have to be bigger. We have to see clearly. We have to speak honestly, and we have to act decisively. That’s what I want to do for you as President of the United States. Thank you.",Sept
George S,Senator Cory Booker.,Sept
Cory Booker,"It was over twenty years ago that I was a law student, and moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, to serve as a tenants’ rights lawyer, to try to address the challenges in my community. I was sobered by them. The gun violence, the substandard housing, but it was my greatest mentor, a woman named Ms. Virginia Jones, who challenged me. She said, “Boy, if all you see in this neighborhood is problems, that’s all there’s ever going to be, but if you’re stubborn, and defiant, and can put forth a vision that can unify people, then we can make transformative change.” She was a church woman that said, “Without vision, the people will perish.”",Sept
Cory Booker,"Well, that’s exactly what we did. We created extraordinary unity in our community, and we did things that other people thought were impossible. That’s the story of America. At our best, we unify. We find common cause and common purpose. The differences amongst us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party. Not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose. That’s why I’m running for president, and that’s how I will lead this nation.",Sept
George S,Entrepreneur Andrew Yang.,Sept
Andrew Yang,"In America today, everything revolves around the almighty dollar. Our schools, our hospitals, our media, even our government. It’s why we don’t trust our institutions anymore. We have to get our country working for us again, instead of the other way around. We have to see ourselves as the owners and shareholders of this democracy, rather than inputs into a giant machine.",Sept
Andrew Yang,"When you donate money to a presidential campaign, what happens? The politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants, and you hope it works out. It’s time to trust ourselves more than our politicians. That’s why I’m going to do something unprecedented tonight. My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families. Someone watching this at home right now. If you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician, go to yang2020.com and tell us how $1,000 a month will help you do just that. This is how we will get our country working for us again, the American people.",Sept
George S,Mayor Pete Buttigieg.,Sept
Voiceover,That’s good.,Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"It’s original. I’ll give you that. The American people are divided and doubtful at the very moment we need to rise to some of the greatest challenges we’ve ever seen. As a mayor of an industrial city coming back from the brink, as a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I know what’s at stake in our national leadership. We keep sending politicians to Washington, asking them to fight for us, but then when they get there, they seem more interested in the part about fighting than the part about us. Good politics is supposed to be not about the day to day fights of the politicians, but about the day to day lives of Americans.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"We just marked the anniversary of 9-11. All day today, I’ve been thinking about September 12th. The way it felt when, for a moment, we came together as a country. Imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity. Imagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time, but big enough, as well, that they could unify the American people. That’s what presidential leadership can do. That’s what the Presidency is for, and that is why I’m asking for your vote.",Sept
George S,Senator Kamala Harris.,Sept
Kamala Harris,"Thank you. It’s great to be back at TSU. I plan on spending tonight talking with you about my plans to address the problems that keep you up at night. First, I have a few words for Donald Trump, who we all know is watching. President Trump, you spent the last two and a half years full time trying to sow hate and division among us, and that is why we’ve gotten nothing done. You have used hate, intimidation, fear, and over 12,000 lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises. The only reason you’ve not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says the sitting president cannot be charged with a crime. Here’s what you don’t get. What you don’t get is that the American people are so much better than this. We know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, regardless of our race, where we live, or the party with which we’re registered to vote. I plan on focusing on our common issues, our common hopes and desires, and in that way, unifying our country, winning this election, and turning the page for America. Now President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News.",Sept
George S,Senator Bernie Sanders. Senator Sanders.,Sept
Bernie Sanders,"Let me be blunt and tell you what you don’t hear much about in Congress, or in the media, and that is it goes without saying that we must and will defeat Trump, the most dangerous president in the history of this country. We must do more. We must do more. We have got to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society, where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country. As president, I am prepared to take them on. Yes, we will raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Yes, we will finally make sure that every American has healthcare as a human right, not a privilege. Yes, we will address the catastrophic crisis of climate change, and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.",Sept
George S,Senator Elizabeth Warren.,Sept
Sen. Warren,"I was born and raised in Oklahoma, but I’m sure glad to be in Texas tonight. All three of my brothers served in military bases here in Texas. That was their ticket to the middle class. Me, I got my big opportunity about a half a mile down the road from here, at the University of Houston, back when it cost $ 50 a semester. For a price that I could pay for on a part time waitressing job, I got to finish my four year degree, and I became a special needs teacher. After law school, my first big job was back here in Houston. By then, I had two little kids, and when childcare nearly brought me down, my Aunt  moved in and saved us all. The paths to America’s middle class have gotten a lot smaller and a lot narrower. Today, service members are preyed upon by predatory lenders. Students are crushed by debt and families cannot afford childcare. I know what’s broken. I know how to fix it, and I’m going to lead the fight to get it done.",Sept
George S,Vice President Joe Biden.,Sept
Joe Biden,"You know, when President Kennedy announced the moon shot, he used a phrase that sticks with me my whole life. He said, “We’re doing it because we refused to postpone.” Well, I refuse to postpone one more minute spending billions of dollars on curing cancer, Alzheimer’s, and other diseases, which if we invest in them, we can find cures. I refuse to postpone giving every single child in America, no matter their zip code, pre-K all the way through high school and beyond. I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change, and leading the world in taking on climate change. Look, this is the United States of America. There has never been a single, solitary time when we’ve set our mind to something that we’ve not been able to do it. We’re walking around with our heads down, like, “Woe is me.” We’re the best equipped nation in the world to take this on. It’s no longer time to postpone. We should get moving. There’s enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump.",Sept
George S,"Candidates, thank you. Several of you said you are more united than divided, and that is certainly true. All of you agree on one big thing, the goal of defeating President Trump, driving the country in a new direction. Out on the campaign trail, you have outlined big differences over how far to go, and how fast to go. Vice President Biden, the differences between you and the senators on either side of you tonight strike at the heart of this primary debate. Both Senators Warren and Sanders want to replace Obamacare with Medicare for all. You want to build on Obamacare, and not scrap it. They proposed spending far more than you to combat climate change and tackle student loan debt, and they would raise more in taxes than you to pay for their programs. Are Senators Warren and Sanders pushing too far beyond where Democrats want to go, and where the country needs to go?",Sept
Joe Biden,"That’ll be for the voters to decide that question. Let me tell you what I think. I think we should have a debate on health care. I know that the senator says she’s for Bernie. Well, I’m for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way in which we add to it, replace everything that’s been cut, add a public option. Guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one.",Sept
Joe Biden,"Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for health care costs a lot of money. It costs $740 billion. It doesn’t cost $30 trillion. $3.4 trillion a year, it turns out, is twice what the entire federal budget is. That’s before it exists now, without interest on the debt. How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear tonight how that’s happened.",Sept
Joe Biden,"As far as my distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it. The senator has in fact come forward and said how he’s going to pay for it, but it gets him about halfway there. There’s a lot of other things that need to be done. I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at risk schools, that are title one schools, from $15 to $45 billion a year. I go down the line, and each of the things we’re talking about, I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done, and why it’s better.",Sept
George S,"Senator Warren, let me take that to you, particularly on what Senator Biden was saying there about healthcare. He’s actually praised Bernie Sanders for being candid about his healthcare plan. Says that Senator Sanders has been candid about the fact that middle class taxes are going to go up, and most of private insurance is going to be eliminated. Will you make that same admission?",Sept
Sen. Warren,"Let’s be clear about healthcare, and let’s actually start where Vice President did. We all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed healthcare in America, and committed this country to healthcare for every human being. Now the question is, how best can we improve on it? I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by healthcare at the lowest possible cost. How do we pay for it? We pay for it. Those at the very top, the richest individuals, and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more, and middle class families are going to pay less. That’s how this is going to work.",Sept
George S,"Direct question. You said middle class families are going to pay less, but will middle class taxes go up to pay for the program? I know you believe that the deductibles and the premiums will go down. Will middle class taxes go up? Will private insurance be eliminated?",Sept
Sen. Warren,"Look, what families have to deal with is cost. Total cost. That’s what they have to deal with. Understand. Families are paying for their health care today. Families pay every time an insurance company says, “Sorry, you can’t see that specialist.” Every time an insurance company says, “Sorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry. We are not covering that prescription.” Families are paying every time they don’t get a prescription filled because they can’t pay for it. They don’t have a lump checked out because they can’t afford the copay. What we’re talking about here is what’s going to happen in families’ pockets. What’s going to happen in their budgets. The answer is, on Medicare for all, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals, and costs are going to go up for giant corporations, but for hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down. That’s how it should work under Medicare for all in our health care.",Sept
George S,"Senator Sanders, you were invoked by the vice president, also. Take on that question about taxes.",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"Joe said that Medicare for all would cost over $30 trillion. That’s right, Joe. Status quo over 10 years will be $50 trillion. Every study done shows that Medicare for all is the most cost effective approach to providing healthcare to every man, woman, and child in this country. I, who wrote the damn bill, if I may say so, intend to eliminate all out of pocket expenses. All deductibles. All copayments. Nobody in America will pay more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, because we’re going to stand up to the greed, and corruption, and price fixing of the pharmaceutical industry. We need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies. To tell you how absurd the system is, tonight on ABC, the healthcare industry will be advertising, telling you how bad Medicare for all is, because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd.",Sept
George S,"Vice President Biden, you were invoked.",Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"If I could respond, George.",Sept
George S,"You get a response, then we’re going to broaden out the discussion.",Sept
Joe Biden,"Okay. Number one, my healthcare plan does significantly cut the cost. The largest out of pocket payment you’ll pay is $1,000. You’ll be able to get into a… Anyone who can’t afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare type option we have, et cetera, but guess what? Of the 160 million people who liked their health care now, they can keep it. If they don’t like it, they can leave. Number one.",Sept
Joe Biden,"Number two. The fact of the matter is, we’re in a situation where, if you noticed, he hadn’t answered the question. This is about candor, honesty, big ideas. Let’s have a big idea. The tax of 2% the senator’s talking about? That raises about $3 billion. Guess what? That leaves you about $28 billion short. The senator said before, it’s going to cost you in your pay. There will be a deductible in your paycheck. The middle class person, someone making 60 grand for three kids, they’re going to end up paying $5,000 more. They’re going to end up paying 4% more on their income tax. That’s a reality. Now, it’s not a bad idea, if you like it. I don’t like it.",Sept
George S,"Okay, now I want everybody to keep to the time, but you did invoke both senators. I have to get responses from them, then we will broaden out. Senator Warren, you go first.",Sept
Sen. Warren,"Let’s be clear. I’ve actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company. I’ve met people who like their doctors. I’ve met people who like their nurses. I’ve met people who like their pharmacists. I met people who like their physical therapists. What they want is access to health care, and we just need to be clear about what Medicare for all is all about. Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies, and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we’re going to do this by saying everyone is covered by Medicare for all. Every healthcare provider is covered. The only question here, in terms of difference, is where to send the bill.",Sept
George S,Senator Sanders.,Sept
Bernie Sanders,"Let us be clear, Joe. In the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians, or any other major country on earth.",Sept
Joe Biden,This is America.,Sept
Bernie Sanders,"Yeah, but Americans don’t want to pay twice as much as other countries, and they guarantee health care to all people. Under my Medicare for all proposal, when you don’t pay out of pocket, and you don’t pay premiums… Maybe you have run into people who love their premiums. I haven’t. What people want is cost effective health care. Medicare for all will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her health care bill.",Sept
George S,"Senator Klobuchar, you said in your opening statement you want to represent the people stuck in the middle of the extremes. Who represents the extreme on this stage?",Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"I think you know that I don’t agree with some of these proposals up here, George. I’m talking about…",Sept
George S,Which ones?,Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"If I could respond to some of the proposals, but from my friends. First of all, Senator Sanders and I have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals. That was a Klobuchar Sanders amendment, to allow for drugs to come in from less expensive countries like Canada. We have worked to bring down the costs by fighting to allow 43 million seniors, that’s a bill I lead, to negotiate for better prices under Medicare. I figure that’s a lot of seniors, and they should be allowed to get a better price.",Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"When it comes to our health care, and when it comes to our premiums, I go with the doctor’s creed, which is do no harm. While Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill. On page eight, on page eight of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it. That means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance. That’s in four years. I don’t think that’s a bold idea. I think it’s a bad idea. What I favor is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning, and that is a public option. A nonprofit choice that will bring down the cost of insurance, cover 12 million more people, and bring down the prices for 13 million more people. That is a bold idea.",Sept
George S,"Senator Warren. Page eight of the bill, she says. 149 people will lose their health insurance.",Sept
Sen. Warren,I’m sorry.,Sept
George S,"She said page eight of the bill, 149 people will lose their health insurance.",Sept
Amy Klobuchar,Current health insurance.,Sept
Joe Biden,149 million.,Sept
George S,Million. Excuse me.,Sept
Sen. Warren,"Let’s be clear about this. People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals. Doctors won’t have to hire people to fill out crazy forms. They won’t have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies. People who have sick family members won’t have to get into these battles. What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for health care for everyone in this country. Insurance companies last year sucked $23 billion in profits out of the system. How did they make that money? Every one of those $23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your healthcare company.",Sept
George S,Mayor Buttigieg.,Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backed…",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"… with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs, is that it doesn’t trust the American people. I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you. Not “My way or the highway”. Now look, I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with the ACA. I propose Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American people, and if we’re right as progressives that that public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves. I trust the American people to make the right choice for them, whey don’t you?",Sept
George S,"Senator Sanders, 45 seconds.",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"George, you talked about, was it 150 million people on private insurance? 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs, or they go unemployed, or their employer changes their insurance policy. Medicare for All is comprehensive healthcare, covers all basic needs, including home healthcare. It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not. So if you want comprehensive healthcare, freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital, no more than 200 dollars a year for prescription drugs, taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies, moving to Medicare for All is a way to go.",Sept
George S,"Senator Harris, you started out co-sponsoring Senator Sander’s bill, you now say you’re uncomfortable with it. Why?",Sept
Kamala Harris,"I want to give credit first to Barrack Obama for really bringing us this far. We would not be here if he hadn’t the courage, the talent, or the will to see us this far. I want to give credit to Bernie. Take credit, Bernie. You brought us this far in Medicare for All. I support Medicare for All, I always have, but I wanted to make the plan better, which I did. Which is about offering people choice, not taking that from them. So under my Medicare for All plan people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan, because that’s what people want, and I agree we shouldn’t take choice from people. But here’s the thing, everybody on this stage I do believe is well-intentioned and wants that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million Americans don’t have coverage. But at least five people have talked, some repeatedly on this subject, and not once have we talked about Donald Trump.",Sept
Kamala Harris,"00 in the morning, killed his attempt to take healthcare from millions of people in this country. Fast-forward to today, and what is happening? Donald Trump’s Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Donald Trump’s administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have preexisting conditions coverage. Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans, and frankly I think this discussion have given the American public a headache. What they want to know is that they’re going to have healthcare and cost will not be a barrier to getting it. But let’s focus on the end goal. If we don’t get Donald Trump out of office he’s going to get rid of all of it.",Sept
Joe Biden,15 seconds?,Sept
George S,"Let me get to Congressman O’Rourke and then … Go ahead, Mr. Vice President.",Sept
Joe Biden,"15 seconds. Look, everybody says we want an option. The option I’m proposing is a Medicare for All in a Medicare for choice. If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your employer, you automatically can buy into this. You don’t have no preexisting condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered. Period. And if you notice, nobody’s yet said how much it’s going to cost the taxpayer. I hear this large savings. My friend from Vermont thinks that employer’s going to give you back if negotiate his union all these years, got to cut wages because you’ve got insurance. They’re going to give back that money to the employee?",Sept
Bernie Sanders,As a matter of fact they will with our bill.,Sept
Joe Biden,"Well, let me tell you something, for a socialist you got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"One minute, George?",Sept
George S,Go ahead.,Sept
Bernie Sanders,"All right. Two points. You got to defend the fact that today, not only do we 87 million people uninsured and underinsured, you got to defend the fact that 500000 Americans are going bankrupt. You know why they’re going bankrupt? Because they suffered a terrible disease. Cancer or heart disease. Under my legislation people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer, and our program is the only one that does that.",Sept
Joe Biden,"I know a lot about cancer. Let me tell you something. It’s personal to me. Let me tell you something. Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately, and we’re talking four, six, eight, 10 years, depending on you talk about, before we get to Medicare for All. Come on. I’ve been there. You’ve been there. You know what it’s like. People need help now, hope now, and do something now.",Sept
George S,Congressman O’Rourke.,Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"Yeah. Thank you. Listen, I’m grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge, and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections that we have right now. But I also think we’re being offered a false choice between those who propose an all-or-nothing gambit, forcing 10s of millions off of insurance that they like, that works for them, to force them onto Medicare, and others who want to, as the Vice President does, incrementally improve what we have, which will still leave many, maybe millions, uninsured and uncared for in a state like Texas where the largest provider of mental healthcare services is the county jail system. We’ve got to do better. In my proposal, Medicare for America, say everyone who’s uninsured will be enrolled in Medicare. Everyone who’s insufficiently insured, cannot afford it, can move over to Medicare, and those like members of unions, who fought for the healthcare plans that work for them and their families, are able to keep them. That is the best possible path forward.",Sept
Joe Biden,This is the  plan.,Sept
George S,"Healthcare is the top issue for everyone in the country. I want to make sure everyone gets one minute to respond. So, Senator Secretary Castro, Andrew Yang, and then Senator Booker, you will get a minute.",Sept
Julian Castro,"Thank you. I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this, and of course we owe a debt of gratitude to President Barrack Obama. Of course, I also worked for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered. Now, on the last debate stage in Detroit you said that wasn’t true when Senator Harris brought that up. There was a fact check of that and they said that was true. I grew up with a grandmother who had Type Two diabetes and I watched her condition get worse and worse, but that whole time she had Medicare. I want every single American family to have a strong Medicare plan available.",Sept
Julian Castro,"If they choose to hold onto strong solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do that, but the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in, and I would not require them to opt in, they would automatically be enrolled. They wouldn’t have to buy in. That’s a big difference, because Barrack Obama’s vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.",Sept
Joe Biden,They do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.,Sept
Julian Castro,You just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in.,Sept
Joe Biden,They do not have to buy in if they can’t afford it.,Sept
Julian Castro,You said they would have to buy in.,Sept
Joe Biden,"Your grandmother would not have to buy in. If she qualified for Medicaid, she’d automatically be in for it.",Sept
Julian Castro,"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I can’t believe that you said two minute ago that they had to buy in, and now you’re saying they don’t have to buy in. You’re forgetting that.",Sept
Joe Biden,"I said anyone, like your grandmother, who has no money, you’re automatically enrolled.",Sept
Julian Castro,"We need a healthcare system that automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job for instance, his healthcare plan would not automatically enroll you, you would have to opt in. My healthcare plan would. That’s a big difference. I’m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you’re not.",Sept
Joe Biden,That’ll be a surprise to him.,Sept
George S,Andrew Yang.,Sept
Andrew Yang,"Come on, guys. Come on.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable, because this reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington, scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that “Your plan, my plan”. Look, we all-",Sept
Julian Castro,"Yeah, that’s called the Democratic Primary Election. That’s called an election. That’s an election. This is what we’re here for, it’s an election.",Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"Yeah, but a house divided cannot stand, and that is not how we’re going to win this election.",Sept
George S,Andrew Yang.,Sept
Andrew Yang,"Look, everyone, we know we’re on the same team here. We know we’re on the same team. We all have a better vision for healthcare than our current president, and I believe we’re talking about this the wrong way. As someone who has a business, I know that our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire people, it makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees. You instead pretend they’re contractors. It’s harder to change jobs. It’s certainly harder to start a business. The pitch we have to make to the American people is we will get the healthcare weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.",Sept
Andrew Yang,"Now, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors, and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy. We have to change the incentives so instead of revenue and activity people are focused on our health in the healthcare system, and the Cleveland Clinic where they’re paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe, shocker, they prescribe fewer procedures, and patient health stays the same or improves. That is the pitch to the American people.",Sept
George S,"Senator Booker, close out this discussion.",Sept
Cory Booker,"Thank you very much. Look, there are a lot of people watching at home right now, listening to us, that are afraid because they are in crisis. They don’t have health insurance, or health insurance doesn’t go far enough, they can’t afford their prescription drugs. Look, I’m clear on what I believe. I believe in Medicare for All. I believe it’s the best way to rationalize the system, but dear god, I know that every one of my colleagues on this stage is in favor of universal health coverage, and comes at this with the best of intentions. I’ll tell you, there is an urgency right now in this nation. Everybody feels it. As a person who has an ideal, I know we cannot sacrifice progress on the alter of purity, because people in my community, they need help right now.",Sept
Cory Booker,"They have high blood pressure right now. They have unaffordable insulin right now. And this must be a moment where we as Democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground, but find common ground, because we’ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one- term president, and we cannot lose it by the way we talk about each other, or demonize and degrade each other. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. If I am the leader I will work towards the ideal of health insurance, health coverage being a right for all Americans, but every single day I’ll join with other Democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today.",Sept
George S,"Candidates, thank you. Lindsey Davis.",Sept
Voiceover,"Thanks, George. Since we’re here at an HBCU, I’d like to start with young black voters. Several recent polls indicate their number one concern is racism. This campus, this state, and this nation are still raw from that racially motivated attack on Latinos in El Paso. Now, we know that the racial divide started long before President Trump and President Obama, but each of you on this stage has said that President Trump has made that divide worse. Congressman O’Rourke, coming to you first. Why are you the most qualified candidate to address this divide?",Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"I called this out in no uncertain terms on August 3rd and every day since then, and I was talking about it long before then as well. Racism in America is endemic, it is foundational. We can mark the creation of this country not at the 4th of July 1776, but August 20th 1619, when the first kidnapped African was brought to this country against his will and in bondage and as a slave build the greatness, the success, and the wealth that neither he nor his descendants would ever be able to fully participate in and enjoy. We have to be able to answer this challenge, and it is found in our education system where in Texas a five year old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended, or expelled, based on the color of their skin.",Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"In our healthcare system where there is a maternal mortality crisis three times as deadly for women of color, or the fact that there’s 10 times the wealth in white America than there is in black America. I’m going to follow Sheila Jackson Lee’s lead and sign into law a reparations bill that will allow us to address this at its foundations. But we will also call out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the White House, and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.",Sept
Voiceover,"Secretary Castro, 45 seconds to explain.",Sept
Julian Castro,"I want to commend Beto for how well he has spoken to the passion and the frustration and the sadness after what happened in his hometown of El Paso. He’s done a great job with that. Look, a few weeks ago a shooter drove 10 hours, inspired by this president, to kill people who look like me and people who look like my family. White supremacy is a growing threat to this country, and we have to root it out. I’m proud that I put forward a plan to disarm hate. I’m also proud that I was the first to put forward a police reform plan, because we’re not going have anymore Laquan McDonalds, or Eric Garners, or Michael Browns, or Pamela Turners, or Walter Scotts, or Sandra Bland here from the Houston area. We need to root out racism, and I believe that we can do that, because that doesn’t represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart. They also need a leader to match that, and I will be a president that matches that.",Sept
Voiceover,"Senator Booker, you have said, quote, “The real question isn’t who is or isn’t a racist, it’s who’s going to do something about it”. Senator, what do you plan to do about it?",Sept
Cory Booker,"Well, first and foremost, I want to hit that point, because we know Donald Trump’s a racist, but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that. Racism exists, the question isn’t “Who isn’t a racist”, it’s “Who is and isn’t doing something about racism?” And this is not just an issue that started yesterday. It’s not just an issue that we hear a president that can’t condemn white supremacy. We have systemic racism that is eroding our nation, from healthcare to the criminal justice system. And it’s nice to go all the way back to slavey, but dear god, we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision today that all the slaves in 1850.",Sept
Cory Booker,"We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism, having the courage to call it out and having a plan to do something about it. If I am President of the United States, we will create an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes, and we will make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans from criminal justice reform to the disparities in healthcare, to even one that we don’t talk about enough, which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice in communities of color all around this country.",Sept
Voiceover,Mayor Buttigieg. You’ve been struggling with issues around race in your own community. You’ve also said that anyone who votes to reelect President Trump is at best looking the other way on racism. Does that sort of talk alienate voters and potentially deepen divisions in our country?,Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"I believe what’s deepened divisions in the country is the conduct of this president, and we have a change all of that. Look, systemic racism preceded this president, and even when we defeat him it will be with us. That’s why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it. It’s not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own. Harms’ compound in the same way that a dollar saved compound, so does a dollar stolen, and we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts in two different countries. I have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"Marshaling as many resources as went into the Marshal Plan that rebuilt Europe, but this time a Douglas Plan that we invest right here at home, to make sure that we’re not only dealing with things like the over-incarceration of black Americans, but also black solutions. Entrepreneurship, raising to 25% the target for the federal government to do business with minority-owned businesses. Investing in HPCUs that are training and educating the next generation of entrepreneurs. We can and must do that, but that means transcending this framework that pits us against each other, that pits a single black mother of three against a displaced autoworker, because where I come from a lot of times that displaced autoworker is a single black mother of three. We’ve got to say that and bring people together.",Sept
Voiceover,"Also a concern for people of color is criminal justice reform. Senator Harris, you released your plan for that just this week, and it does contradict some of your prior positions. Among them, you used to oppose the legalization of marijuana, now you don’t. You used to oppose outside investigations of police shootings, now you don’t. You’ve said that you’ve changed on these and other things, because you were, quote, “Swimming against the current and thankfully the currents have changed”, but when you had the power, why didn’t you try to affect change then?",Sept
Kamala Harris,"I’m glad you asked me this question, and there have been many distortions of my record. Let me be very clear. I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons, one, I’ve always wanted to protect people and keep them safe, and second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias, and I could tell you extensively about the experiences I and my family members have personally had. But I made a decision that if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try to do it from the inside. So I took on the position that allowed me, without asking permission, to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who are arrested for drugs and getting them jobs. I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full-time.",Sept
Kamala Harris,"I created one of the first in the nation training for police officers on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system. Was I able to get enough done? Absolutely not, but my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration, about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system. I plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on day one. It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable, and finally, my plan is about making sure that in America’s criminal justice system we de-incarcerate woman and children, that we end solitary confinement, and that we work on keeping families intact. And as President of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete.",Sept
Voiceover,"Thank you, Senator Harris. Senator Klobuchar, during your eight years as a prosecutor in Minnesota there were dozens of incidents where black men were killed by police. Critics say that too often you sided with police in these cases. The ACLU’s legal director in Minnesota has said that you showed no interest in racial justice. Do you wish now that you had done more?",Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"That’s not my record. We are here at a historically black college, and I think of an alum of that college, Barbara Jordan, and something she once said. She said “What the people want is simple. They want a country as good as it’s promise”, and that same can be said of the criminal justice system. So when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand make sure outside investigators handled them. I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis, but in the prosecutor’s office they were handled with a grand jury. That’s how they were all handled across our state. I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself. That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did, 400 people in our office. The cases that came to us, the African-American community that came to us, they said there was no justice for their little kids. There was a kid named Byron Philips that was shot on his front porch. No one had bothered to figure out who did it.",Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"When I came into that office, we worked with the community groups, we put up billboards, we found the shooter and we put him in jail. We did the same for the killer of a little girl named Taisha Edwards who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window. What changes did we make? Go after white collar crimes in a big way. Diversify the office in a big way. Work with the Innocence Project to make sure we do much better with eyewitness ID, and as a senator and as your President I will make sure that we don’t just do the First Step Act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the Second Step Act, which means the 90% of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails, let’s reduce those sentences for non-violent offenders and let’s get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison.",Sept
Voiceover,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. You all believe that the War On Drugs has put too many Americans behind bars. Vice President Biden, you have a plan to release many non-violent drug offenders from prison. Senator Booker says that your plan is not ambitious enough. Your response?",Sept
Joe Biden,"Well, first of all, let me say that when I came back from law school I had a job with a big time law firm. I left and became a public defender because my state was under siege. When Dr. King was assassinated we were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months. I’ve been involved from the beginning. As a young councilman I introduced legislation to try to keep them putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with redlining. Banks should have to lend where they operate, etc. The fact of the matter is that what’s happened is that we’re in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn’t be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation. Nobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime. When we were in the White House we released 36000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem.",Sept
Joe Biden,"They should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons. I’m the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. So we have to change the whole way we look at this, and we put people in prison, we have to equip them when they get out. Nobody who got in prison for marijuana for example immediately upon being released they shouldn’t be in there for a misdemeanor. That should be a misdemeanor, they should be out and their record should be expunged. Every single right should be returned. When you finish your term in prison you should be able to not only vote, but have access to Pell Grants, have access to be able to get housing, have access to be able to move along the way. I’ve laid out a detailed plan along those lines, and the fact is we’ve learned so much more about-",Sept
Voiceover,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President.",Sept
Joe Biden,Thank you.,Sept
Voiceover,"Senator Booker, 45 seconds to respond.",Sept
Cory Booker,"Our criminal justice system is so savagely broken. There’s no difference in American between blacks, whites, and Latinos for using drugs or dealing drugs, but if you’re African-American you’re almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated, destroying your lives. And so much of this comes down to privilege. We have a criminal justice system that Bryan Stevenson says “Treats you better if you’re rich and guilty than if you’re poor and innocent”. So I have challenged this whole field. We can specifically and demonstratively now show that there are 17000 people unjustly incarcerated in America, and all of us should come forward and say “When I am President of the United States we will release them”, and let me be specific. I joined together and led in the United States Senate the only major bipartisan bill to pass onto this president for criminal justice reform, that has already led to 1000s of people coming out of jail.",Sept
Cory Booker,"If 87 members of the United States Senate says that these sentences are way too long and we changed it, but we didn’t make it retractive, we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now. Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17000 people, and I challenge you, don’t just say big statements, back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation, which is liberty and freedom. We need to reform this system and we must do it now. Every day we wait is too long.",Sept
Voiceover,"Thank you, Senator Booker. David.",Sept
David Muir,"Thank you, Lindsey. I want to turn to the deadly mass shootings here in this country, and of course we are all mindful tonight of where we stand. We are here in Texas tonight where 29 people have lost their lives in just the last month along. El Paso, which we’ve discussed, and Odessa, and I know there are survivors from El Paso right here in the hall tonight. Vice President Biden, I do want to direct this to you because we all remember Sandy Hook. 26 people died in that school, 20 of them children. Those first graders would be in eighth grade today. At the time there was a groundswell in this country to get something done. President Obama asked you to lead the push for gun control. You have often pointed to your ability to reach across the aisle to get things done, but four months after Sandy Hook a measure to require expanded background checks died on the senate floor. If you couldn’t get it done after Sandy Hook, why should voters give you another chance?",Sept
Joe Biden,"Because I’ve got it done before. I’m the only one up here who’s ever beat the NRA. Only one to ever beat the NRA nationally. I’m the guy that brought the Brady Bill into focus and became law. So that’s number one. Number two, after Sandy Hook a number of things happened. It’s went from a cause to a movement. Look what’s happened now. Mothers, the organization, Mothers Against Gun Violence. We’ve seen what’s happened again. Now we have all these young people marching on Washington, making sure that things are going to change. There has been a sea change. Those proposals I put forward for the president had over 50% of members of the NRA supporting them, and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them. Now the numbers are much higher, because they realize what I’ve been saying, and we’ve all been saying, is correct. Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons …",Sept
Joe Biden,"Correct. Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street, period. And we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements. So the point is things have changed and things have changed a lot and now what’s happening is, and by the way, the way Beto handled, excuse me for saying Beto congressman.",Sept
Beto O’Rourke,That’s all right. That sounds good.,Sept
Joe Biden,"The way he handled what happened in his home town is meaningful. The look in the eyes of those people to see those kids, to understand those parents, to understand the heartache, we are ready to do this.",Sept
David Muir,Mr vice president. Thank you. You did bring up assault weapons here and many of you on this stage have talked about executive orders. Senator Harris you have said that you would take executive action on guns within your first 100 days including banning imports of AR15 assault weapons.,Sept
Kamala Harris,That’s right.,Sept
David Muir,"President Obama after Sandy Hook, more than 23 executive actions and yet here we are today. In recent days, former vice president Biden has said about executive orders. Some really talented people are seeking the nomination. They said, “I’m going to issue an executive order.” Biden saying there’s no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say, I’m going to eliminate assault weapons, saying you can’t do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things. When he says he can do it by executive order, does the vice president have a point there?",Sept
Joe Biden,"Some things you can, many things you can’t.",Sept
David Muir,Let’s let the Senator answer.,Sept
Kamala Harris,"I mean I would just say, “Hey Joe instead of saying that we can’t let say yes we can.”",Sept
Joe Biden,That’s not constitutional. We got a constitution.,Sept
Kamala Harris,"Yes we can. Because I’ll tell you something. The way that I think about this is I’ve seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you. And the idea that we would wait for this congress, which has just done nothing to act is just… It is overlooking the fact that every day in America our babies are going to school to have drills. Elementary, middle and high school students where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school.",Sept
Kamala Harris,"I was talking about this at one of my town halls and this child was eight years old probably, came up to me. It was like it was a secret between the two of us and he tugged on my jacket and he said, “I had to have one of those drills.” It is traumatizing our children, El Paso and Beto God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy. People asked me in El Paso, they said, because I have a long standing record on this issue. They said, “Well, do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?” And I said, “Well, look. I mean, obviously he didn’t pull the trigger, but he’s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.”",Sept
David Muir,"Senator Harris, thank you. Vice president Biden, do you still stand by what you said on executive order?",Sept
Joe Biden,"What I said was speak to constitutional scholars. If in fact we could say, “By the way, you can’t own the following weapons period. It cannot be sold anymore.” Check with constitutional scholars.",Sept
David Muir,"Mr vice president, thank you. Congressman O’Rourke.",Sept
Kamala Harris,Could I tell you what you could do to respond today?,Sept
David Muir,"I’m going to work down the row here, but I do want to come to congressman O’Rourke because I know this is personal to you. El Paso is your hometown. Some on this stage have suggested a voluntary buyback for guns in this country. You’ve gone further, you said, “Americans who owned AR15s and AK47 will have to sell them to the government. All of them.” You know the critics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns and how would this work?",Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"I am. If it’s a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield. If the high impact, high velocity round when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that. So that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers. When we see that being used against children and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15 year old girl who was shot by an AR15 and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour. Because so many other people were shot by that AR15 in Odessa and Midland, there weren’t enough ambulances to get to them in time. Yes. We’re going to take your AR15, your AK47. We’re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.",Sept
David Muir,Thank you congressman.,Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"And I want to say this, I’m listening to the people of this country. The day after I proposed doing that, I went to a gun show in Conway, Arkansas to meet with those who are selling AR15s and AK47s and those who are buying those weapons. And you might be surprised there was some common ground there. Folks who said, “I would willingly give that up, cut it to pieces. I don’t need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself. It is a weapon of war.” So let’s do the right thing but let’s bring everyone in America into the conversation. Republicans, Democrats, gun owners and non gun owners alike.",Sept
David Muir,Congressman thank you. I want to bring in Senator Klobuchar on this because you’ve often talked about your uncle and the proud hunters back home in Minnesota. So I wanted to get your response to congressman O’Rourke tonight. Where do you stand on mandatory gun buybacks?,Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"I so appreciate what the congressman’s been doing and I want to remind people here that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. Everyone up here favors an assault weapon pan. Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which by the way would have made a huge difference if that was in place in El Paso, in that store where all those ordinary people showed such extraordinary courage and certainly in Dayton, Ohio, where in 30 seconds one man guns down innocent people. The cops got there in one minute and it still wasn’t enough to save those people. That’s what unites us.",Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"You know what else unites us? And I’ll tell you this, what unites us is that right now on Mitch McConnell’s desk are three bills, universal background checks, closing the Charleston loophole and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers don’t get AK47.",Sept
David Muir,Senator Klobuchar.,Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"It’s time to get something done. And I personally think we should start with the voluntary buyback program. That’s what I think David. But I want to finish this because if you want action now, we got to send a message to Mitch McConnell. We can’t wait until one of us gets in the White House. We have to pass those bills right now to get this done.",Sept
David Muir,Senator Klobuchar.,Sept
Amy Klobuchar,Because we cannot spare another innocent life.,Sept
David Muir,"Thank you. I want to turn to Senator Booker because you have said just this week about guns and about the candidates on this stage that the differences do matter. Those were your words. You have argued if you need a license to drive a car in this country, you should have a license to buy a gun. Gun owners would not only have to pass a background check, they would have to obtain a federal license to buy a gun. This would require, as you know, congress to pass legislation. If Democrats can’t get universal background checks, how would you get this done? And can you name one Republican colleague of yours in the Senate right now who would be on board with this idea?",Sept
Cory Booker,"So background checks and gun licensing, these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans, 83% of Americans agree with licensing. This is the issue. Look, I grew up in the suburbs. It was about 20 years ago that I came out of my home when I moved to inner city New Jersey, and witnessed the aftermath of a shooting. It’s one of the reasons why shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades, this has been a crisis for me. It’s why I was the first person to come out for gun licensing. And I’m happy that people like Beto O’Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing, but this is what I’m sorry about. I’m sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change. This is a crisis of empathy in our nation.",Sept
Cory Booker,"We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood, our community before we demand action. You want to know how we get this done? We get this done by having a more courageous empathy where people don’t wait for this hell to visit upon their communities. They stand up and understand the truth of what King said, that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. I will lead change on this issue because I have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine. Because we forget national shootings, these mass shootings or tragedies, but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine. Nobody has ascended to the White House that will bring more personal passion on this issue. I will fight this and bring a fight to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby like they have never seen before.",Sept
David Muir,"Senator Booker. Thank you. A quick follow up though, because Americans watching tonight know the reality of Congress in Washington. I asked you how the Republican colleague in the Senate who would be on board with this idea to get this done.",Sept
Cory Booker,"If that was the attitude when Strom Thurmond had the longest filibuster ever on civil rights. If it was this idea that we can’t get it done because of the situation in the Senate, I’m looking to lead a movement. The number one reason why governments are formed is to protect the citizenry. Think about this. We have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined from the revolutionary war till now. This is not a side issue to me, it is a central issue to me. That is the kind of fight because the majority of homicide victims, we have a mass shooting every single day in communities like mine.",Sept
Cory Booker,"We must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country, so we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those Republicans who are not even representing their constituency. Because the majority of Americans, the majority of gun owners agree with me, not the corporate gun lobby. It is time for a movement on this issue and I will lead it.",Sept
David Muir,"Senator Booker, thank you. Senator Warren, I want to come to you next because you have actually said in recent days that there are things you can get done with Republicans in the Senate. What can you get done on gun control?",Sept
Sen. Warren,"So let’s start by framing the problem the right way. We have a gun violence problem in this country. The mass shootings are terrible, but they get all the headlines. Children die every day on streets, in neighborhoods, on playgrounds. People die from violence, from suicide and domestic abuse. We have a gun violence problem in this country and we agree on many steps we could take to fix it. My view on this is it’s not going to be won and done on this. We’re going to do it and we’re going to have to do it again and we’re going to have to come back some more until we cut the number of gun deaths in this country significantly. But here’s the deal. The question we need to ask is when we’ve got this much support across the country, 90% of Americans want to see us do…",Sept
Sen. Warren,"I like registration… Want to see us do background checks, want to get assault weapons off the streets. Why doesn’t it happen? And the answer is corruption, pure and simple. We have a congress that is beholden to the gun industry and unless we’re willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster, we’re not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said, let’s do background checks, let’s get rid of assault weapons and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster. Until we attack the systemic problems. We can’t get done reform in this country. We’ve got to go straight against the industry and we’ve got to change congress so it doesn’t just work for the wealthy and well conducted. So it works for the people.",Sept
David Muir,"Senator Warren, thank you. You bring up eliminating the filibuster, which means you would need simply a simple majority in a Republican Senate to get something done. I want to turn to Senator Sanders on this because you’ve said before of this, if Donald Trump supports ending the filibuster, which he’s talked about himself, you should be nervous. Would you support ending the filibuster?",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"No, but what I would support absolutely is passing major legislation, the gun legislation the people here are talking about. Medicare for all, climate change legislation that saves the planet. I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen. And you could do it in a variety of ways. You could do that through budget reconciliation law. You have a vice president who will in fact tell the senate what is appropriate and what is not, what is an order and what is not.",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"But I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made and that in fact, in terms of gun issues, picking up on Corey and Beto and everybody else, what we are looking at is a corrupt political system. And that means whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining what’s happening in Washington or in this case you got an NRA which has intimidated the president of the United States and the Republican leadership. I am proud that year after year I had an F rating from the NRA and as president, I will not be intimidated by the NRA.",Sept
David Muir,"Senator Sanders, thank you.",Sept
Kamala Harris,Can I respond?,Sept
Jorge Ramos,"We’ve been hearing a lot about what’s been happening here in Texas only a few weeks ago. The deadliest massacre of Latinos in modern US history happening in the States in El Paso. So the if you’re among Latinos, and you know this is very real. So let me start with an issue that is causing a lot of division in this country, immigration. Vice president Biden as a presidential candidate in 2008 you supported the border wall saying, “Unlike most Democrats, I voted for 700 miles of fence.” This is what you said. Then you served as vice president in an administration that deported 3 million people, the most ever in US history. Did you do anything to prevent those deportations? I mean, you’ve been asked this question before and refused to answer, so let me try once again. Are you prepared to say tonight that you and president Obama made a mistake about deportations? Why should Latinos trust you?",Sept
Joe Biden,"What Latinos should look at is comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous. Number one, we didn’t lock people up in cages. We didn’t separate families. We didn’t do all of those things, number one. Number two, this is the president who came along with the DACA program, no one had ever done that before, the president sent legislation to desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America. This is the president has done a great deal, so I’m proud to have served with him. What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed.",Sept
Joe Biden,"I would in fact make sure that we immediately surge to the border. All those people are seeking asylum, they deserve to be heard. That’s who we are. We’re a nation that says if you want to flee and you’re fleeing oppression, you should come. I would change the order that the president just changed saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum. And by the way, retrospectively, you know the 25th anniversary of the violence against women act is up. The Republican Congress has not reauthorized it. Let’s put pressure on them to pass the violence against women act now.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,You didn’t answer the question. No. Did you make a mistake with those deportations?,Sept
Joe Biden,The president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time.,Sept
Jorge Ramos,How about you?,Sept
Joe Biden,I’m the vice president of the United States.,Sept
Jorge Ramos,"Secretary Castro, would you want to respond to Biden? And let me put this in context because your party controlled the White House and Congress in 2009 and didn’t pass immigration reform. And just broke a promise made by president Barack Obama to Latinos. So why should voters trust Democrats now? I mean now it is even more difficult as you know, because you need Republican votes in the Senate. So are you willing, for instance, to give up DACA or give up a path to citizenship or even agree to build a wall in order to legalize 10.5 million undocumented immigrants?",Sept
Julian Castro,"Jorge, thank you very much for that question. And you look, I agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump. Donald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants. He built his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fear-mongering and otherizing migrants, and that’s very different for Barack Obama. But my problem with vice president Biden and Corey pointed this out last time, is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, “I was there. That’s me too.” And then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, “Well, that was the president.” I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama’s work, but not have to answer to any questions.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,"Vice president Biden, you have…",Sept
Julian Castro,I don’t get that.,Sept
Jorge Ramos,You have 45 seconds.,Sept
Julian Castro,Let me just say-,Sept
Joe Biden,That’s not what I said. That’s not what I said.,Sept
Julian Castro,"I was the first candidate in early April to put forward an immigration plan. You know why? Because I’m not afraid of Donald Trump on this issue. I’m not going to back pedal. I’m not going to pretend like I don’t have my own vision for immigration. So we’re not going to give up DACA. We’re not going to give up protections for anybody. I believe that on January 20th, 2021 we’re going to have a democratic president. We’re going to throw out Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and have a democratic Senate and a democratic house, and we’re going to pass immigration reform within the first hundred days.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,"Vice president, 45 seconds.",Sept
Joe Biden,"I did not say don’t stand… I stand with Barack Obama all eight years. Good, bad, and indifferent. That’s where I stand. I did not say I did not stand with him.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,"Okay. Senator Warren, hundreds of children have been separated from their parents at the border and recently in Mississippi we saw the largest immigration rate in a decade. You want to replace ICE, the agency in charge of rounding up undocumented immigrants. So how would you deal with the millions of immigrants who arrived legally, but overstayed their visas? And how would you stop hundreds of thousands of central Americans who want to migrate to the US?",Sept
Sen. Warren,"Well, I start with a statement of principles and that is in this country, immigration does not make us weaker, immigration makes us stronger. I want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our dreamers, but also for their grandparents and for their cousins, for people who’s overstayed student visas, and for people who came here to work in the fields. I want to have a system that is a path to citizenship that is fair and achievable. Down at the border, we’ve got to rework this entirely. A system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist, a criminal and a 12 year old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer and it is not serving our values.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,Mr. Yang.,Sept
Sen. Warren,"I want to add one more part on this because I think we have to look at all the pieces. Why do we have a crisis at the border? In no small part because we have withdrawn help from people in Central America who are suffering. We need to restore that help, we need to help establish and reestablish the rule of law so that people don’t feel like they have to flee for their lives. We have a crisis that Donald Trump has created and hopes to profit from politically. We have to have the courage to stand up and fight back.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,"Mr. Yang, it is true that in the last few years we have seen the most severe anti-immigrant measures from putting kids in cages to limiting and asylum for people fleeing gangs and domestic violence. But it is also true that about 1 million immigrants enter the US legally every year. So are you willing to raise the number of legal immigrants from 1 million to 2 million per year? And should there be a merit system as president Trump wants?",Sept
Sen. Warren,Did you ask me?,Sept
Jorge Ramos,Mr. Yang.,Sept
Sen. Warren,"He said it, okay. Sorry.",Sept
Andrew Yang,"My father grew up on a peanut farm in Asia with no floor and now his son is running for president. That is the immigration story that we have to be able to share it with the American people. If you look at our history, almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants and rates of business formation are much higher in immigrant communities. We have to say to the American people, immigrants are positive for economic and social dynamism. And I would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the Obama, Biden administration.",Sept
Andrew Yang,"I think we have to compete for talent and I am the opposite of Donald Trump in many ways. He says, “Build a wall.” I’m going to say to immigrants, “Come to America, because if you come here, your son or daughter can run for president. The water’s great and this is where you want to build a company, build a family, and build a life.” This country has been a magnet for human capital for generations. If we lose that, we lose something integral to our continued success and that is where I would lead as president.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,"Pete, eight out of 10 Latinos in Texas in another mass shooting targeting them. This is according to a new television post. President Trump has called Mexican immigrants, rapists and killers, tried to ban Muslims from entering the country and separated children from their parents. His supporters kept chanting, build a wall and send her back. Do you think that people who support president Trump and his immigration policies are racist?",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"Anyone who supports this is supporting racism. . The only people though who actually buy into this president’s hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don’t know any. We have an opportunity to build an American majority around immigration reform. In my community, a group of conservative Republicans rallied around an individual, a beloved local individual who was deported when he went in to ICE to try to get his paperwork sorted out because they never thought it would happen to him. In some of the most conservative rural areas of Iowa, I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow. And it’s why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America, includes community renewal visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting not only for jobs, but for population to embrace immigration as we have in my city.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"The only reason that South Bend is growing right now after years of shrinking is immigration. It’s one of the reasons we acted, not waiting for Washington to create city issued municipal IDs. So that people regardless of immigration status in our city, had the opportunity to have the benefits of identification. We have an opportunity to actually get something done.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,Thank you.,Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"But we cannot allow this to continue to be the same debate with the same arguments and the same clever lines, often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s. We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities, but our values. Values of welcome, values of faith that all argue for us to manage this humanely and in a way that marries our values with our laws.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,"Congress Beto O’Rourke  in an interview eight months ago, you were asked what to do with a so-called overstay, people who come with a visa and then stay and you said, “I don’t know.” Do you have an answer now?",Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"I do, and if you read the rest of that article in the Washington Post, I talked about harmonizing our entry exit system with Mexico in the same way that we do with Canada. I think that could help us to keep a handle on visa overstays but I think the larger question that we’re trying to get at is how do we rewrite this country’s immigration laws in our own image? In the image of Houston, Texas, the most diverse city in the United States of America. In the image of El Paso, Texas, one of the safest cities in the United States of America. Safe not despite the fact that we are a city of immigrants, safe because we are a city of immigrants. .",Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"I will lead an effort to make sure that we rewrite our immigration laws in that way, never cage another child. Make sure that there is accountability and justice for the seven lives lost under our care and our custody. But also face the fact that Democrats and Republicans alike voted to build a wall that has produced thousands of deaths of people trying to cross to join family or to work a job. That we have been part of deporting people hundreds of thousands just in the Obama administration alone who pose no threat to this country, breaking up their families. Democrats have to get off the back foot, we have to lead on this issue because we know it is right. Legalize America, begin with those more than 1 million dreamers. Make them US citizens right now in this, their true home country, and extend that to their parents, their sisters and their brothers, and ensure that we have a legal, safe, orderly system to come to this country and add to our greatness here.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,"Thank you, George.",Sept
George S,"Jorge, thank you. We’re going to take a quick break when we come back, national security, foreign policy, the impact on American jobs and US troops.",Sept
Speaker 1,"Texas Southern University in Houston, the Democratic Debate.",Sept
George S,"Welcome back. We want to turn now to national security and the foreign policy issue that has such a direct impact here at home, the US relationship with China, trade and president Trump’s tariffs. We received more than a hundred questions from viewers wanting to know how all of you are going to handle these tariffs, and Mr. Yang, let me begin with you. Would you repeal the tariffs on your first day in office. and if so, would you risk losing leverage in our trade relationship with China?",Sept
Andrew Yang,"I would not repeal the tariffs on day one, but I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal. Because right now the tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers in Iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the imbalances that we have with China.",Sept
Andrew Yang,"A CEO friend of mine was in China recently and he said that he saw pirated US intellectual property on worker workstations to the tune of thousands of dollars per head. And he said, “One, how can my workers compete against that? And two, think about all the lost revenue to American companies.” So the imbalances are real, but we have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that president Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides. So no to repealing the tariffs immediately, but yes, to making sure we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers.",Sept
George S,"Mayor Pete, let me take that question to you, because you’ve seen president Trump’s tweets. He says what’s going to happen here is the Chinese are just going to wait him out so they can get a Democrat who they can take advantage of. How do you think about China? We’ve seen president Trump called president Xi both an enemy and a friend.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, the president clearly has no strategy. You know, when I first got into this race, I remember president Trump scoffed and said he’d like to see me making a deal with Xi Jinping. I’d like to see him making a deal with Xi Jinping.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"Is it just me or was that supposed to happen in like April? It’s one more example of a commitment not made. When that happens on the international stage, people take note, not just our competitors, our adversaries, but also our allies. Take note of the inability of the United States to keep its word or follow through on its plans. And when that happens, there are serious consequences.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"We saw it at the G7, the leaders of some of the greatest powers and economies of the world sitting to talk about one of the greatest challenges in the world, climate change, and there was literally an empty chair where American leadership could have been. The problem is this is a moment when American leadership is needed more than ever, whether it’s in Hong Kong where those protestors for democracy need to know that they have a friend in the United States or anywhere around the world where increasingly we see dictators throwing their weight around. The world needs America, but it can’t be just any America. .",Sept
George S,Would you repeal the tariffs?,Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"I would have a strategy that would include the tariffs as leverage, but it’s not about the tariffs. Look what’s going on right now is a president who has reduced the entire China challenge into a question of of tariffs, when what we know is that the tariffs are coming down on us more than anybody else, and there’s a lack of a bigger strategy.",Sept
George S,"Senator Klobuchar, you’ve actually supported the tariffs on steel?",Sept
Sen Klobuchar,"What we’ve got right now though, George, it’s not a focus tariff on steel. What he has done here, he has assessed these tariffs on our allies. He has put us in the middle of this trade war and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos. And if we are not careful, he is going to bankrupt this country.",Sept
Sen Klobuchar,"One forecast recently says that it has already cost us 300,000 jobs. All right? There is soybeans that are mounting up in bins all over the Midwest in my state of Minnesota and in Iowa. So what I think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table. That’s what I would do. I wouldn’t have put all these tariffs in place and I wouldn’t have had a trade policy where on August 1st he announces he’s going to have tariffs on $300 billion of goods, on August 13th he cuts it in half, a week later he says he’s going to reduce taxes. The day after that he says he’s not going to do it.",Sept
Sen Klobuchar,"The leaders of the world are watching this and it undermines our strength as a nation. And yes, we want fair trade, but we must work with the rest of the world and he has made a mockery of focused trade policy, which I think means enforcement like we’ve done in Northern Minnesota, passing bills, getting president Obama to do more on that so that our workers can benefit. So we are importing, exporting goods and making sure that it is a competitive policy where our goal is that we are making things, inventing things and exporting to the world. He is defeating that goal.",Sept
George S,"Secretary Castro, you actually in one of the previous debates identified China as the most serious national security threat to our country. I want to pick up on what Senator Klobuchar was saying that she had said she’d go back to the negotiating table. The question is, what do you do for leverage? Where do you get it?",Sept
Julian Castro,"Well, look, I agree with those who have said that this erratic, haphazard trade war is hurting American families. As Senator Klobuchar said, 300,000 American jobs. It’s estimated that it’s cost $600 to the average American family. Just a couple of days ago 60% of Americans said that they believe that we’re in for a recession next year.",Sept
Julian Castro,"So when I become president, I would immediately begin to negotiate with China to ratchet down that trade war. We have leverage there. I also believe though, that we need to return to a leader when it comes to things like human rights. We have millions of Uyghurs for instance, in China, that right now are being imprisoned and mistreated. And in North Korea, this president is elevating a dictator. We need to stop that, we need to return to ensuring that America leads again on human rights.",Sept
Julian Castro,"When it comes to this trade war, I would immediately begin ratcheting that trade war down. We have leverage in that discussion.",Sept
George S,"Senator Warren, let me bring you in on this conversation. President Obama signed the transpacific partnership In part, it was designed to reign in China, to bring China in to some kind of regulation. What do you think he got wrong?",Sept
Sen. Warren,"So our trade policy in America has been broken for decades and it has been broken because it works for giant multinational corporations and not for much of anyone else. These are giant corporations that, shoot, if they can save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country, they’ll do it in a heartbeat. And yet, for decades now, who’s been whispering in the ears of our trade negotiators, who has shaped our trade policy? It’s been the giant corporations. It’s been their lobbyists and their executives.",Sept
Sen. Warren,"The way we change our trade policy in America is first, the procedures, who sits at the table. I want to negotiate trade with unions at the table. I want to negotiate it with small farmers at the table. I want to negotiate with environmentalists at the table. I want to negotiate with human rights activists at the table.",Sept
Sen. Warren,"And you ask the question about leverage, if I can just respond to that one. The leverage, are you kidding? Everybody wants access to the American market. That means that we have the capacity to say right here in America, “You want to come sell goods to American consumers? Then you’ve got to raise your standards. You’ve got to raise your labor standards and you’ve got to raise your environmental standards so our companies can compete on a level playing field.” We can use trade not to undermine American workers and not to undermine American farms and not to undermine small businesses in this country. We can use trade to help build a stronger economy.",Sept
George S,"Senator Harris, how would your trade policy different from president Obama’s?",Sept
Kamala Harris,"Well, first of all, I have no criticism of that more than just looking at where we are now, which is that we’ve got a guy in The White House who has been erratic on trade policy. He conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly born out of his fragile ego. It has resulted in farmers in Iowa with soy beans rotting in bins looking at bankruptcy. When we look at this issue, my trade policy under a Harris administration is always going to be about saying, “We need to export American products, not American jobs.” And to do that we have to have a meaningful trade policy. I am not a protectionist Democrat. Look, we need to sell our stuff, and that means we need to sell it to people overseas. That means we need trade policies that allow that to happen.",Sept
Kamala Harris,"You asked earlier about China, it’s a complicated relationship. We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property. They dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable.",Sept
Kamala Harris,"We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that that presents. We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea. I am on, and I think the only person on this stage, the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Homeland security committee. We need a partner on the issue of North Korea. But the bottom line is this, Donald Trump in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in the Wizard of Oz, you know, when you pull back the curtain it’s a really small dude.",Sept
Speaker 1,"Okay. I’m not even going to take the bait Senator Harris, but I am going to take this to  take this to Senator Sanders right now",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"There is a reason why in the last 45 years, the average American today, despite an explosion of technology and work or productivity, is not making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago. And one of the reasons is that for decades we have had disastrous trade policies.",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"And I got to say to my good friend Joe Biden, Joe and I strongly disagree on trade. I helped lead the opposition to NAFTA and PNTR, which cost this country over four million good paying jobs. And what happened is people who had those jobs ended up getting other jobs making 50% of what they made in manufacturing.",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"So Trump obviously hasn’t a clue. Trump thinks that trade policy is a tweet at three o’clock in the morning. What we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers, represents the farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere. We’re losing billions right now because of Trump’s policy. A trade policy which understands that if a company shuts down in America and goes abroad and then thinks they’re going to get online to get a lucrative federal contract, under Bernie Sanders, they got another guess coming.",Sept
George S,"Vice president Biden, he invoked your name.",Sept
Joe Biden,"Yeah, well look, we’re either going to make the policy or China’s going to make the rules of the road. We make up 25% of the world economy. We need another 25% to join us, and I think Senator Warren is correct. At the table has to be labor, and at the table have to be environmentalists.",Sept
Joe Biden,"The fact of the matter is, China, the problem isn’t the trade deficit. The problem is they’re stealing our intellectual property. The problem is they’re violating the WTO. They’re dumping steel on us. That’s a different issue than whether or not they’re dumping agricultural products on us.",Sept
Joe Biden,"In addition to that, we’re in a position where if we don’t set the rules, we in fact are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules. And that’s why you need to organize the world to take on China to stop the corrupt practices that are underway.",Sept
George S,"Senator Booker, close out this round.",Sept
Corey Booker,Sure.,Sept
Corey Booker,"There’s one point we’re really missing on this stage right now, which is the fact that Donald Trump’s America First policy is actually an America isolated, an America alone policy. .",Sept
Corey Booker,"From trade, to battling China, to the global crisis of climate change, the challenges in the Middle East. He is pulling us away from our allies, out of the Iran deal, out of the Paris climate accords. And on trade he’s deciding to take on China while at the same time taking on tariff battles with all of our allies.",Sept
Corey Booker,"You literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. Now look, I’m the only person on the stage that finds Trudeau’s hair very menacing, but they are not a national security threat. We cannot go up against China alone. This is a president that has a better relationship with dictators like Duterte and Putin than he does with Merkel and Macron.",Sept
Corey Booker,"We are the strongest nation on the planet earth and our strength is multiplied and magnified when we stand with our allies in common cause and common purpose. That’s how we beat China, that’s how we beat climate change on the planet earth and that’s how American values are the ones that lead on issues of trade and workers’ rights.",Sept
George S,David.,Sept
David Muir,"George, thank you.",Sept
David Muir,"I want to turn now to our troops overseas and to America’s longest war in Afghanistan. US talks with the Taliban are dead according to the president. Secret talks at Camp David have been canceled before they could happen. Many of you have weighed in on that already, so I want to move past that tonight to what all of you have promised on the campaign trail. Many of you on this stage have said you’d bring the troops home in your first term, others have said in your first year.",Sept
David Muir,"Senator Warren, we all know the presidency is much different from the campaign trail. President Obama wanted to bring the troops home, President Trump promised to bring the troops home, and you have said of Afghanistan, “Let’s help them reach a peace settlement. It is time to bring our troops home,” in your words, “Starting right now.” Would you keep that promise to bring the troops home starting right now with no deal with the Taliban?",Sept
Sen. Warren,"Yes, and I’ll tell you why. What we’re doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States, it is not helping the safety and security of the world, it is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan. We need to bring our troops home and then we need to make a big shift. We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily. We’re not going to bomb our way to a solution in Afghanistan. We need to treat the problem of terrorism as a worldwide problem and that means we need to be working with all of our allies, our European allies, our Canadian allies, our Asian allies, our allies in Africa and in South America. We need to work together to root out terrorism. It means using all of our tools, it means economic investment, it means expanding our diplomatic efforts instead of hollowing out the state department and deliberately making it so we have no eyes and ears in many of these countries. We need a foreign policy that is about our security and about leading on our values.",Sept
David Muir,"Senator Warren, a quick follow on that because top US leaders, military leaders on the ground in Afghanistan told me you can’t do it without a deal with the Taliban. You just said you would  you would bring them home. What if they told you that, would you would listen to their advice?",Sept
Sen. Warren,"I was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer. I think it may have been Senator McCain’s last trip before he was sick. And I talked to people, we did, we talked to military leaders, American and local leaders. We talked to people on the ground and ask the question, the same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee every time one of the Generals comes through. Show me what winning looks like, tell me what it looks like. And what you hear is a lot of  because no one can describe it and the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military.",Sept
Sen. Warren,"I have three older brothers who all served in the military. I understand firsthand the kind of commitment they have made. They will do anything we ask them to do, but we cannot ask them to solve problems that they alone cannot solve. We need to work with the rest of the world. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools, we need to build with our allies and we need to make the whole world safer, not keep troops bombing in Afghanistan.",Sept
David Muir,"Senator Warren, thank you.",Sept
David Muir,"I do want to stay on this and I’m going to turn to Mayor Buttigieg, because you’re the only veteran on this stage who served in Afghanistan. We heard in recent days from General Joseph Dunford, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said in recent days, “I’m not going to use the word withdrawal right now. It’s our judgment the Afghans need support to deal with the level of violence.” If he’s not even using the word withdrawal, would you put your promise to bring troops home in the first year on hold to follow the advice?",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"You know I served under General Dunford, way under General Dunford in Afghanistan. And today, September 12th, 2019 means that today you could be 18 years old, old enough to serve, and have not been alive on 9/11. We have got to put an end to endless war. And the way we do it is see to it that that country will never again be-",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"… that that country will never again be used for an attack against our homeland, and that does not require an open-ended commitment of ground troops.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"Let me say something else, because if there’s one thing we’ve learned about Afghanistan … from Afghanistan, it’s that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place. And so when I am president, an authorization for the use of military force will have a built-in three-year sunset. Congress will be required to vote and a president will be required to go to Congress to seek an authorization. Because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas, the least our members of Congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"By the way, we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props, or worse, tools for his own enrichment. We saw what’s going on with flights apparently being routed through Scotland just so people can stay at his hotels. I’ll tell you, as a military officer, the very first thing that goes through your mind the first time you ever make eye contact with somebody that you were responsible for in uniform is, “Do not let these men and women down.” This president is doing exactly that. I will not.",Sept
David Muir,"Mayor Buttigieg, thank you.",Sept
David Muir,"I want to turn to Vice President Biden, because the concerns about any possible vacuum being created in Afghanistan if you pulled the US troops out has been heightened by what we’ve seen in recent days on the ground in Iraq. When you were vice president, President Obama turned to you to bring the troops home from Iraq. You have said on the campaign trail, “I made sure the president turned to me and said, ‘Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq.'” There was a major drawdown of US troops, and then ISIS seized, by some estimates, 40% of the territory in Iraq. You then had to send thousands of troops back in. Was it wrong to pull out of Iraq that quickly? And did the move actually help ISIS take hold?",Sept
Joe Biden,"No, it wasn’t wrong to pull out, but I want to answer the Afghanistan question. I’ve been in and out of Afghanistan, not with a gun, and I admire my friend for his service, but I’ve been in and out of Afghanistan I think more than anybody on this … And it’s an open secret. You reported a long time ago, George, that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan. The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counter insurgency, meaning that we’re going to put that country together. It can not be put together. Let me say it again, it will not be put together. It’s three different countries. Pakistan owns the three counties … the three provinces in the east. There are not any part of the  run it. I will go on and on.",Sept
Joe Biden,"But here’s the point. The point is that it’s a counter-terrorism strategy. We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases, insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to airlift from, and to move against what we know. We don’t need those troops there. I would bring them home. And Joe Dunford’s a fine guy, but this has been an internal argument we’ve had for eight years.",Sept
Joe Biden,"With regard to Iraq, the fact of the matter is that I should’ve never voted to give Bush authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do. The AUMF was designed, he said, to go in and get the security council to vote 15 to nothing, to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons. And when that happened, he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof.",Sept
Joe Biden,"I said something that was not meant the way I said it. I said from that point on what I was argued against in the beginning, once he started to put the troops in, was that, in fact, we were doing it the wrong way. There was no plan. We should not be engaged. We didn’t have the people with us. We didn’t have our aligned … We didn’t have allies with us, etc. And it was later when we came into office, that Barack, the president, turned to me and said, “Joe …” when they said we got to plan to get out, he turned to the whole security, and said, “Joe will organize this. Get the troops home.”",Sept
Joe Biden,"My son spent a year in Iraq, and I understand, and we were right to get the combat troops out. The big mistake that was made, which we predicted, was that you would not have a circumstance where the Shia and the Kurds would work together to keep ISIS from moving in. Now-",Sept
David Muir,"Mr. Vice President, thank you. I want to turn to Senator Sanders on this, because the concern over Afghanistan is very similar to what we saw in Iraq. When the troops came out, ISIS filled that vacuum. What do you make of people out there who are worried that if we pull out US troops too quickly from Afghanistan, it will create safe haven all over again, like the plotters of 9/11?",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"David, let me answer that, but let me just comment on something that the vice president said. You talked about the big mistake in Iraq and the surge. The truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me, I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq.",Sept
Joe Biden,You’re right.,Sept
Bernie Sanders,"I voted against the war in Iraq and helped lead the opposition. And it’s sad to say, I mean, I kind of had the feeling that there would be massive destabilization in that area if we went into that war.",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"As the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I want to pick up on what Pete said, we cannot express our gratitude to all of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us, who have responded to the call of duty. But I think also, I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of Trump’s military budgets. I don’t think we have to spend $750 billion a year on the military when we don’t even know who our enemy is.",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"I think that what we have got to do is bring this world together, bring it together on climate change, bring it together in fighting against terrorism, and make it clear that we, as a planet, as a global community, we’ll work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies, and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism. But dropping bombs on Afghanistan and Iraq was not the way to do it.",Sept
David Muir,"Senator Sanders, thank you. I want to take this to Mr. Yang. You share the stage, as you know, when we talk about troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the vice president, who was in the situation room, with senators who were on the Senate Arms Services, the foreign relations committees, with an Afghanistan veteran who is on the stage tonight. As you share the stage with these candidates, what makes you the most qualified on this stage to be commander-in-chief?",Sept
Andrew Yang,"I’ve signed a pledge to end the forever wars. We’ve been in a state of continuous armed conflict for 18 years, which is not what the American people want. We have to start owning what we can and can’t do. We’re not very good at rebuilding countries. And if you want proof, all you have to do is look within our own country at Puerto Rico. We’ve spent trillions of dollars to unclear benefits, lost thousands of lives. And thank you, Pete, for your service.",Sept
Andrew Yang,"And the goal has to be to rebuild the relationships that have made America strong for decades. I would lead our armed forces with restraint and judgment. What the American people want is simply a president who has the right values and point of view, and they can trust to make the right decisions when it comes to putting our young men and women into harm’s way. And that’s what I would do as president.",Sept
David Muir,"Mr. Yang, thank you. Jorge.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,"Thank you very much. . You haven’t been asked about Latin America in the previous debates, so let’s begin. Senator Sanders, one country where many immigrants are arriving from is Venezuela. A recent UN fact-finding mission found that thousands have been disappeared, tortured, and killed by government forces in Venezuela. You admit that Venezuela does not have free elections, but still you refuse to call Nicolas Maduro un dictador, a dictator. Can you explain why? And what are the main differences between your kind of socialism and the one being imposed in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua?",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"Well, first of all, let me be very clear. Anybody who does what Maduro does is a vicious tyrant. What we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela so that the people of that country can make and can create their own future.",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"In terms of democratic socialism, to equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe, is extremely unfair. I’ll tell you what I believe in terms of democratic socialism. I agree with what goes on in Canada and in Scandinavia, guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right. I believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave. I believe that every worker in this country deserves a living wage, and that we expand the trade union movement.",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"I happen to believe also that what, to me, democratic socialism means, is we deal with an issue we do not discuss enough, Jorge, not in the media, and not in Congress. You got three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country. You got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in Wall Street, the insurance companies, and in the media. Maybe, just  maybe, what we should be doing-",Sept
Jorge Ramos,Thank you.,Sept
Bernie Sanders,"… is creating an economy that works for all of us, not 1%. That’s my understanding of democratic socialism.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,"you wanted to say a quick response, 45 seconds.",Sept
Julian Castro,"Sure. Thank you, Jorge. I’ll call Maduro a dictator, because he is a dictator. And what we need to do is to, along with our allies, make sure that the Venezuelan people get the assistance that they need, that we continue to pressure Venezuela so that they’ll have free and fair elections. And also, here in the United States, offer a temporary protected status, TPS, to Venezuelans. That is something that the Trump administration has failed to do. For all of his big talk about supporting the Venezuelan-American community, he has failed. I will not.",Sept
Julian Castro,"I also believe that we need to do things like a 21st-century Marshall Plan for Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to make the dangerous journey to the United States. And under my administration, we’re going to put renewed focus on Latin America. It makes sense. They’re our neighbors, and we have a lot of things in common.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,Thank you.,Sept
Julian Castro,"It also makes sense that, because we have a country like China that is going around the world to places like Africa and Latin America, making their own relationships, strengthening those, the United States needs to strengthen its partnerships in Latin America immediately.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,Thank you -,Sept
Julian Castro,And I will.,Sept
Jorge Ramos,"Senator Booker, let me ask you about Brazil. After the recent fires in the Amazon, some experts suggested that eating less meat is one way to help the environment. You are a vegan since 2014. That’s obviously a personal choice. But President Trump and Brazil’s President Bolsonaro are concerned that climate change regulations could affect economic growth. So should more Americans, including those here in Texas and in Iowa, follow your diet?",Sept
Corey Booker,"No. Look, let’s just be clear, the factory farming going on that’s assaulting this corporate consolidation of the agriculture industry, one of the reasons why I have a bill to put a moratorium on this kind of corporate consolidation is because this factory farming is destroying and hurting our environment. And you see independent family farmers being pushed out of business because of the kind of incentives we are giving that don’t line up with our values. That’s what I’m calling for.",Sept
Corey Booker,"But I want to switch, because we don’t have … a crowded debate stage. We were talking about Afghanistan and Iraq. It annoys me that we had a conversation about our troops overseas and we didn’t say one word about veterans in our country. We have a shameful reality in America that we send people off to war and they often come home with invisible wounds, hurts and harms. They’re disproportionately homeless. You hear stories about women waiting for months for gynecological care through the VA. It is very important that we as a country understand that we are not going to solve every problem with this outrageous increased militarism, that we also make sure that we stand up for the people that stood for us. We end our national anthem with “home of the brave.” It’s about time we make this a better home for our bravest.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,“What meaningful action will you take to reverse the effect of climate change? And can we count on you to follow through if your donors are against it?,Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"Yes, we will follow through regardless of the political consequences or who it offends, because this is the very future of our planet and our ability for our children and grandchildren to be able to survive on it. We will make sure that we get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than the year 2050, that we are halfway there by 2030, that we mobilize $5 trillion over the next 10 years to do that, that we invest here in Houston, Texas with pre-disaster mitigation grants to protect those communities that are vulnerable to flooding. Given the fact that this town has seen three 500-year floods in just five years, you’d like to think you’re good for 1,500 years, but you’re not. They’re coming faster, and larger, and more devastating than ever.",Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"We’re also going to make sure that we free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable wind and solar energy technology, as well as the high-paying, high-skill, high-wage jobs that come along with that. And then we’re going to pay farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide. Planting cover crops, keeping more land under conservation, using no-till farming, regenerative agriculture can pull carbon out of the air and can drive it and sequester it into the soil. That’s the way that we’re going to meet this challenge, and we’re going to bring everyone into the solution.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,Many of you want to comment. Let’s try to see if we can go very fast. Senator Klobuchar.,Sept
Sen Klobuchar,"Thank you. This is the existential crisis of our time. You know that movie, The Day After Tomorrow? It’s today. We have seen a warming in our world like never before. We’re seeing flooding in the Midwest, flooding in Houston, fires in the West. And I think having someone leading the ticket from the Midwest will allow us to talk about this in a different way and get it done.",Sept
Sen Klobuchar,"On day one, I will get us back into the international climate change agreement. On day two, I will bring back the Clean Power rules that president Obama had worked on. On day three, I will bring back the gas mileage standards. You can do all that without Congress, which is good. On day four, five, and six, I will, working with Congress and mayors and businesspeople all over the country, introduce sweeping legislation to get at that 2050 goal.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,Thank you.,Sept
Sen Klobuchar,"And on day seven, you’re supposed to rest, but I won’t.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,Senator Warren-,Sept
Sen Klobuchar,This is what we need to do if we’re going to get at climate change. We have to take this on as a crisis that’s happening right now.,Sept
Jorge Ramos,"Senator Warren, should American foreign policy be based around the principle of climate change?",Sept
Sen. Warren,"Yes. We need to work on every front on climate change. It is the threat to every living thing on this planet, and we are running out of time. Every time the scientists go back, they say we have less and less time than we thought we had. But that means we’ve got to use all the tools. One of the tools we need to use are our regulatory tools. I have proposed, following, Governor Inslee, that we, by 2028, cut all carbon emissions from new buildings, by 2030, carbon emissions from cars, and by 2035, all carbon emissions from the manufacture of electricity. That alone, those three, will cut our emissions here in the United States by 70%. We can do this.",Sept
Sen. Warren,"We also need to help around the world to clean, but understand this one more time, why doesn’t it happen?",Sept
Jorge Ramos,Thank you.,Sept
Sen. Warren,"As long as Washington is paying more attention to money than it is to our future, we can’t make the changes we need to make. We have to attack the corruption head on so that we can save our planet.",Sept
Jorge Ramos,"Senator Harris, 45 seconds.",Sept
Kamala Harris,"When I think about this issue, it really is through the lens of my baby nieces who are one and a half and three years old. When I look at what is going to be the world if we do nothing, when they turn 20, I am really scared. And when I’ve been in the United States Senate for now the last two and a half years, and I look at our counterparts, the Republicans in the United States Senate, they must be looking at their children. And then when they look at the mirror, I don’t know what they see, but it’s a lack of courage.",Sept

I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States. Second only to the United States Department of Justice. I took on the big oil companies. We saw progress.,Sept
Kamala Harris,"If any of you have been to Los Angeles  20 years ago, you’ll remember, that sky was brown. You go there now the sky is blue. You know why? Because leader decided to lead. We took on these big fossil fuel companies. We have some of the most important and strongest laws-",Sept

Kamala Harris,We made a difference. My point being I’ve done it before and I will lead as president on this issue because we have no time. The clock is ticking-,Sept
Speaker 2,Thank you.,Sept
Kamala Harris,… but we need courage and we need courageous leadership. We can get this done.,Sept
Speaker 2,Mr. Yang.,Sept
Andrew Yang,"To follow up on what Elizabeth said, why are we losing to the fossil fuel companies? Why are we losing to the gun lobby and the NRA? The answer is this, we all know, everyone on this stage knows, that our government has been overrun by money and corporate interests. Now everyone here has a plan to try and curb those corporate interests, but we have to face facts. Money finds a way. Money will find its way back in.",Sept
Andrew Yang,"What is the answer? The answer is to wash the money out with people powered money. My proposal is that we give every American 100 democracy dollars that you can only give to candidates and causes that you like. This would washout the lobbyist cash by a factor of eight to one. That is the only way we will win. As someone running for president I’ll tell you, there’s the people on one side and the money on the other. The only way for us to win is if we bring them together.",Sept
Speaker 2,Thank you Mr. Yang.,Sept
Speaker 2,.,Sept
Lindsey Davis,"I’d like to have an academic discussion now about education. Mr. Yang we’ll stay with you. Here in Houston the school district is facing yet another year of spending cuts. Like schools across the country the system faces many challenges. One of them, thousands of students are leaving traditional public schools and going to charter schools. You are the most vocal proponent on this stage for charter schools.",Sept
Lindsey Davis,"You have said that Democrats who want to limit them are, quote, “Just jumping into bed with teacher’s unions and doing kids a disservice.” Why isn’t tax payer money better spent on fixing traditional public schools?",Sept
Andrew Yang,"Let me be clear, I am pro good school. I’ve got a kid … One of my little boys just started public school last week, and I was not there because I was running for president. We need to pay teachers more because the data clearly shows a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold. We need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized tests, which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human word.",Sept
Andrew Yang,"But here’s the big one, the data clearly shows that 65 to 70 percent of our students’ outcomes are determined outside of the school. We’re talking about time spent at home with the parents, words read to them when they’re young, stress levels in the house, income, type of neighborhood. We’re putting money into schools, and educators know this. We’re saying, “You’re 100% responsible for educating our kids but you can only control 30%.” They all know this. The answer is to put money directly into the families and neighborhoods to give our kids a chance to learn, and our teachers a chance to teach.",Sept
Lindsey Davis,"Mayor Buttigieg, 45 seconds to respond.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"Step one is appoint a Secretary of Education who actually believes in public education. I believe in public education. In order to strengthen it some things are very complex, for preparing for a future where knowledge is at your fingertips but we got to teach more to do with critical thinking, and social and emotional learning. Some of it is extremely simple, we’ve just got to pay teachers more. We’ve got to lift up the teaching profession.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"I always think of a story from South Bend of friends who hosted exchange students from Japan. They had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher. They kept in touch with her when she went back to Japan and to college. She took the exam to try to become a teacher, in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well. She came up just short. You know what she did? Since she was academically good but couldn’t quite make the cut to be a teacher? She had a fallback plan. She became a doctor. That is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,If we want to get the results that we expect for our children we have to support and compensate the teaching profession. Respect teachers the way we do soldiers and pay them more like the way we do doctors.,Sept
Lindsey Davis,"Senator Warren, to use Mr. Yang’s term, are you just jumping into bed with teacher’s unions?",Sept
Sen. Warren,"I think I’m the only person on this stage who has been a public school teacher. I’ve wanted to be a public school teacher since I was in 2nd grade. Let’s be clear in all the ways we talk about this, money for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else. I’ve already made my commitment. We will have a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher.",Sept
Sen. Warren,I think this is ultimately about our values. I have proposed a two cent wealth tax on the top 1/10 of 1% in this country. That would give us enough money to start with our babies by providing universal child care for every baby age zero to five. Universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old in this country.,Sept
Lindsey Davis,Thank you Senator.,Sept
Sen. Warren,Raise the wages of every childcare worker and pre-school teacher in this country. Cancel student loan debt for 95% of the folks who’ve got it.,Sept
Lindsey Davis,Thank you Senator.,Sept
Sen. Warren,"Strengthen our unions. This is how we build an America that reflects our values, not just where the money comes from with the billionaires and corporate executives.",Sept
Lindsey Davis,"Senator Harris, 45 seconds to respond.",Sept
Kamala Harris,"My first grade teacher, Mrs. Francis Wilson, God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation. I think most of us would say that we are not where we are without the teachers who believed in us. I have offered, in this campaign, a proposal to deal with this, which will be the first in the nation, Federal investment enclosing the teacher pay gap. Which is $13,500 a year. Because right now in our public schools our teachers, 94% of them are coming out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies. That is wrong.",Sept
Kamala Harris,"I also want to talk about where we are here at TSU and what it means in terms of HBCUs. I have, as part of my proposal, that we will put two trillion dollars into investing in our HBCUs for teachers. Because one, as a proud graduate of a historically black college and university I will say that is our HBCUs that disproportionately produce teachers and those who serve in these many professions. But also-",Sept
Lindsey Davis,Thank you Senator.,Sept
Kamala Harris,But this is a critical point. If a black child has a black teacher before the end of third grade they are 13% more likely to go to college. If that child has had two black teachers before the end of third grade they are 32% more likely to go to college. When we talk about investing in our public education system it is at the source of so much. When we fix it that will fix so many other things. We must invest in the potential-,Sept

Kamala Harris,… of our children.,Sept
Lindsey Davis,Senator Sanders-,Sept
Kamala Harris,I strongly believe you can judge a  society based on how it treats its children and we are-,Sept
Lindsey Davis,Thank you Senator.,Sept
Kamala Harris,… failing on this issue.,Sept
Bernie Sanders,"Guess what? You’re guessing. All right, here’s the answer. We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Yet we have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on Earth. We have teachers in this country who are leaving education because they can’t work two or three jobs to support themselves, which is why under my legislation we’ll move to see that every teacher in America makes at least $60,000 a year.",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"What we will also do is not only have universal pre-K, we will make public colleges, and universities, and HBCUs debt free. What we will also do, because this is an incredible burden on millions and millions of young people who did nothing wrong except try to get the education they need, we are going to cancel all student debt in this country.",Sept
Lindsey Davis,Thank you Senator. Thank you.,Sept
Bernie Sanders,We are going to do that by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.,Sept
Lindsey Davis,"Thank you  Senator. Mr. Vice President, I want to come to you, and talk to you about inequality in schools, and race. In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975 you told a reporter, “I don’t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather. I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation. I’ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.” You said that some 40 years ago, but as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?",Sept
Joe Biden,"Well they have to deal with the … Look, there is institutional segregation in this country. From the time I got involved I started dealing with that. Redlining banks. Making sure that we are in a position where … Look, we talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title 1 schools, triple the amount of money we spend from 15 to 45 billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise so they equal raise of getting out of the $60,000 level.",Sept
Joe Biden,"Number two, make sure that we bring into help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home. We have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. It’s crazy. The teachers are … I’m married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We make sure that every single child does in fact have three, four, and five year olds go to school. School. Not daycare, school. We bring social workers into homes and parents, to help them deal with how to raise their children.",Sept
Joe Biden,It’s not that they don’t want to help. They don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio. Make sure the television … Excuse me. Make sure you have the record player on at night. Make sure the kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor background will hear four million words fewer spoken by the time they get there. There’s so much we can-,Sept
Lindsey Davis,Thank you Mr. Vice President.,Sept
Joe Biden,"No, I’m going to go like the rest of them do, twice over. Okay? Because here’s the deal. The deal is that we’ve got this a little backwards.",Sept
Joe Biden,"By the way, in Venezuela we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela. I know Maduro. I’ve confronted Maduro.",Sept
Joe Biden,"Number two, you talk about the need to do something to Latin America. I’m the guy that came up with 740 million dollars to see to it those three countries, in fact, changed their system so people don’t have a chance to leave. You’re all acting like we just discovered this yesterday. Thank you very much.",Sept
Lindsey Davis,Thank you Mr. Vice President.,Sept
Lindsey Davis,Secretary Castro.,Sept
Julian Castro,"Thank you very much. Well that’s quite a lot.  But I grew up in one of those neighborhoods that folks have talked about. In a neighborhood that was grappling with the legacy of segregation. In fact in two public school districts that were involved in a 1973 Supreme Court case, challenging how Texas financed its schools.",Sept
Julian Castro,"I know that today our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated. Now I have an education plan, like a lot of folks up here, that would pay teachers more. That would recruit diverse ranks of teachers. That would invest in our public schools, but I also believe that we have to connect the dots. To uplift the quality of life. To invest in housing opportunity, to invest in job opportunity, to invest in community schools that offer resources like parents able to go back and get their GED. Healthcare opportunities. Those things that truly ensure that the entire family can prosper. Those are the types of things we need to do, in addition to lifting up our public schools.",Sept
Julian Castro,"You asked a second ago about charter schools. Look, it is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools. They’re not.",Sept
Lindsey Davis,Thank you Secretary.,Sept
Julian Castro,"Well I’m not categorically against charter schools, I would require more transparency and accountability from them than is required right now.",Sept
Lindsey Davis,"Senator Booker, coming to you know. It was 65 years ago this year that the Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation in public schools. Yet for millions of students of color today segregation remains a reality. Non-white districts typically receive $2,200 less per student than those in white districts. This means older books, less access to computers, and often worse outcomes. What is your plan to address segregation? I’m not just talking about the achievement gap, but I’m talking about the opportunity gap in education.",Sept
Corey Booker,"I’m hearing a lot of conversations on the stage and the way we talk about communities of color. Look I live in a black and brown community below the poverty line. I’ve lived in  Housing Projects for almost a decade and saw the anguish of parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they don’t have a school that serves their genius. I think I’m the only person on the stage, even though I had no formal authority as Mayor to run a school system, I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools. We produce results.",Sept
Corey Booker,"A lot of folks here talking about raising teachers salary. We actually did it in Newark, New Jersey. We didn’t stop there. We closed poor performing charter schools, but dagnabbit we expanded high performing charter schools. We were a city that said, “We need to find local solutions that work for our community.” The results speak for themselves. We’re now the number one city in America for Beat the Odds schools. From high poverty to high performance. Strategies like investing in our children work.",Sept
Corey Booker,"I’ll tell you this. I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated, disconnected from the other issues. That’s why my friend Secretary Castro is 100% right. We are in the reality we are right now because Vice President of overtly racist policies, not 400 years ago just in my lifetime. That were redlining communities, disinvesting in communities. More than just that, my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation, and housing, and the challenges of underfunded schools, but they’re also struggling with environmental injustice. If you’ve talked to someone who’s a parent of a child who has had permanent brain damage because of lead, you’ll know this is a national problem because there’s over 3,000 jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint, Michigan.",Sept
Lindsey Davis,Thank you Senator.,Sept

From raising teachers’ salary, fully funded special education, but combating the issues of poverty, combating the issues of racial segregation, combating the issues of a criminal justice system that takes-",Sept

Speaker 3,Thank you Lindsey. One final question coming up. We’ll be right back.,Sept
George S.,"… a round of questions. One question for each candidate. We’re going to go in reverse order from the opening statement and the candidates. The question is on the quality of resilience. No president can succeed without resilience. Every president confronts crises, defeats and mistakes. So, I want to ask each of you, what’s the most significant professional setback you’ve had to face? How did you recover from it, and what did you learn from it? Vice President Biden.",Sept
Joe Biden,"I never counted any professional setback I have as a serious setback. There’s things that are important, things that aren’t important.",Sept
George S.,We’re going to clear the protestors now. Just one minute.,Sept
George S.,"Senator Biden, we’ll start the clock again.",Sept
Speaker 3,.,Sept
Joe Biden,What’d they say?,Sept
Joe Biden,I’m sorry.,Sept
George S.,We’re sorry. Go ahead.,Sept
Joe Biden,"There are setbacks to the setbacks, and I think the most critical setback that can occur to anyone is to lose … Well, my dad had an expression. He said, “Joey, it’s not a question of succeeding and whether you get knocked down, it’s how quickly you get up.” He used to say, “You never explain and never complain.” Then go on to say that, “The only obligation that really matters, the most important thing is family.”",Sept
Joe Biden,"So, I was raised to believe that that was the center of everything, family, and could be judged on based how you treat your family and how you went from there. It took … you know, Kierkegaard said, “Faith sees best in the dark.”",Sept
Joe Biden,"Right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, and my two sons were badly injured. I’d just been elected, not sworn in. I lost my faith for awhile. I came back. Then later when my son Beau came home from Iraq and with a terminal disease and a year later, a year and a half later, losing him was like losing part of my soul. The fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose, purpose in what you do.",Sept
Joe Biden,"That’s why I hope he’s proud of me today because he wanted to make sure I didn’t run for president but I stayed engaged. Because when you get hit badly, whether you’re losing a job or you’re raising a family, like my dad, where you have to make that longest walk up the stairs to tell your kid, “You can’t live here anymore.” Dad lost his job. You know, we’ve all been through that some form or another. It just takes … just for me, the way I’ve dealt with it is finding purpose. My purpose is to do what I’ve always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy.",Sept
Joe Biden,"There’s a lot of people who went through a lot worse than I have and get up every single morning, put their feet one foot in front of another without the help I had. There are real heroes out there, some real heroes.",Sept
George S.,"Thank you, Mister Vice President. Senator Warren.",Sept
Sen. Warren,"I mentioned earlier, I’ve known what I wanted to be since second grade. I wanted to be a public school teacher, and I invested early. I used to line my dollies up and teach school. I had a reputation for being tough but fair. By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn’t have money for a college application, much less to send me off to four years at a university.",Sept
Sen. Warren,"My story, like a lot of stories, has a lot of twists and turns. I got a scholarship. Then at 19, I got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over. I got a chance down the road at the university of Houston, and I made it as a special needs teacher. I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher. I could tell you what those babies looked like. I had four to six year olds.",Sept
Sen. Warren,"At the end of that first year I was visibly pregnant. Back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me … wished me luck and hired someone else for the job. So, there I am. I’m at home, I’ve got a baby, I can’t have a job. What am I going to do? Here’s resilience. I said, “I’ll go to law school.” The consequence was, I practiced law for about 45 minutes and then went back to my first love, which is teaching. It let me get into fights. It gave me new tools. The reason I’m standing here today is because I got back up. I fought back. I know what’s broken. I want to be in the fight to fix it in America.",Sept
George S.,"Thank you, Senator.",Sept
Sen. Warren,That’s why I’m here.,Sept
George S.,Senator Sanders.,Sept
Bernie Sanders,"I’d say that resilience to me means growing up in a rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. Professional resilience means to me, George, running for US Senate in Vermont and getting one percent of the vote, running for governor and getting two percent of the vote. Finally, becoming mayor of Burlington, Vermont with ten vote margin.",Sept
Bernie Sanders,"What resilience means to me is that throughout my political career, I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country, whether it is Wall Street, whether it is the insurance industry, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry whose corruption and greed is killing people today, whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex. I feel confident that given a lifelong record I’ve taken on powerful special interests of standing up for the working families of this country, that I will be able to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create a government and an economy that works for all of us. Not just the one percent.",Sept
George S.,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. Senator Harris.",Sept
Kamala Harris,"Every office I’ve run for, whether it be district attorney or attorney general, I was told each time it can’t be done. They said, “Nobody like you has done it before. You’re … nobody is ready for you.” When I ran for DA, I won and became the first Black woman elected DA in a state of 40 million people in San Francisco. When I ran for Attorney General of California, I was elected because I didn’t listen. I was the only Black elected woman, Black elected attorney general in the state, in the country.",Sept
Kamala Harris,"Each time people would say, “It’s not your time. It’s not your turn. It’s going to be too difficult. They’re not ready for you.” I didn’t listen. A part of it probably comes from the fact that I was raised by a mother who said many things that were life lessons for me, including, “Don’t you ever let anybody tell you who you are. You tell them who you are.”",Sept
Kamala Harris,"When I look around the town halls that we do in this race for President of the United States and I look at the meetings that we do and the community meetings and I see these little girls and boys sometimes even brought by their fathers. They bring them to me, and I talk to them during these events and they smile. They’re full of joy and their fathers tell them, “See, don’t you ever listen and let anybody ever tell you what you can or cannot be. You have to believe in what can be unburdened by what has been.”",Sept
George S.,"Senator Harris, thank you very much. Mayor Buttigieg.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"As a military officer serving under, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” and as an elected official in the State of Indiana when Mike Pence was governor, at a certain point when it came to professional setbacks, I had to wonder whether just acknowledging who I was was going to be the ultimate career ending professional setback. I came back from deployment and realized that you only get to live one life, and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer. So, I just came out. I had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be, especially because inconveniently it was an election year in my socially Conservative community.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"What happened was that when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and reelected me with 80% of the vote. What I learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what’s worth more to you than winning. I think that’s what we need in the presidency right now. We have to know what we are about.",Sept
Pete Buttigieg,"This election is not about any of us up here. It is not about this President, even though it’s hard to talk of anything else some days. It’s about the people who trust us with their lives. A kid wondering if we’re actually going to make their schools safe when they’ve learned active shooter drills before they’ve learned to read, a generation wondering whether we will actually get the job done on climate change. If we hold to that, then it doesn’t matter what happens to each of us professionally. Together we will win a better era for our country.",Sept
George S.,"Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. Mister Yang.",Sept
Andrew Yang,"I was an unhappy lawyer for five whole months, and I left to start a business. I’m going to share with you all one of the secrets to entrepreneurship. If you want to start something, tell everyone you know you’re going to do it. Then you don’t have a choice. You put your heart and soul into it. Even though I did that, my company flopped, had its mini rise and maximum fall, lost investors, hundreds of thousands of dollars. Still owed 100,000 in school debt. My parents still told people I was a lawyer. I guess it was a little easier.",Sept
Andrew Yang,"So, I remember lying on my floor, looking up, wondering how did it come to this, Eventually, I picked myself back up. I kept working in small growth companies for another ten years and eventually had some success. Then after I did have some success, I still remembered how hard it was, how isolating it was, how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you. So, I spent seven years starting and running a nonprofit that helped train young entrepreneurs around the country, including Sean Wen, who’s here in the audience tonight who left his gilded Wall Street job to become a food entrepreneur in San Antonio. Sean, I hope I made the process a little bit easier for you than it was for me. The goal of my campaign is to make this an economy that allows us to live our human values and aspirations.",Sept
George S.,"Thank you. Thank you, Mister Yang. Senator Booker.",Sept
Cory Booker,"My biggest professional setback is embarrassing, because a lot of folks know about it. I, with a bunch of tenant leaders in Newark, New Jersey in 2002, took on the political machine. Boy, did they fight back. I had tires on my car slashed. Our campaign offices were broken into. My phones were tapped. It became a spectacle, and we lost that election. Here’s a bit of advice to everybody. If you’re going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it because it made for an Oscar nominated documentary called Street Fight. But hen unfortunately, another setback, it lost in the Oscars to a movie called March of the dag nab Penguins, for crying out loud.",Sept
Cory Booker,"The people in my community of living in the projects told me, “Don’t give up on the people, and the people won’t give up on you. Create bigger and bolder coalitions, and you’re going to win.” You know what? We came back four years later and won the largest lopsided victory in our city’s history.",Sept
Cory Booker,"More than that, the lesson was there. We didn’t give up. We were taking on America’s toughest problems from crime to poverty. We transformed our city, creating tens of thousands of new jobs, the biggest economic expansion in our city, and as I said before, turned around our school system. There’s more work to do, but I haven’t given up on the people. I still live in that community.",Sept
Cory Booker,"This is the big lesson. My staff and my friends and my community told me, “If you want to go fast, you may have won the mayor’s race, but that’s not what life is about.” There’s an old African saying that says, “If you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go together.” The lesson I learned of resilience is to trust people, because the power of the people is always greater than the people in power. The test of America right now, it’s not a referendum on Donald Trump. It’s a referendum on us and who we are and who we’re going to be together. We need to use this moment in history to unite in common cause and common purpose, and then there’s nothing we can’t do together as a nation.",Sept
George S.,"Senator Booker, thank you. Congressman O’Rourke.",Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"Thank you, George. Everything that I’ve learned about resilience, I’ve learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas. In the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community in large part by the President of the United States that killed 22 people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that nor were we defined by that. The very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us set the example for the rest of this country. We don’t see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous. We see them as foundational to our success, to our strength and to our security and to our safety.",Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"Yesterday, I was visiting with one of those victims. He’s the head coach of the Fusion. This is a girl’s soccer team of ten and 11 year old girls. His name is Luis. He was shot in the legs multiple times. He was shot in the side multiple times. He’s still healing from his wounds in the hospital, but from his hospital bed, he’s still trying to coach the Fusion girls soccer team. Memo, his co-coach, is still fighting for his life right now at Del Sol Hospital. Those two men, Jessica and Marcella, their wives, they exemplify resilience to me.",Sept
Beto O’Rourke,"When we end this scourge of gun violence in this country, when we finally confront the racism that exists in America, when we’re defined not by our fears but instead by our aspirations and our ambitions, it will be in large part, I think, thanks to the example that El Paso has set.",Sept
George S.,"Congressman, thank you.",Sept
Beto O’Rourke,Thank you.,Sept
George S.,Senator Klobuchar.,Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"My challenges and resilience have brought me up here. I grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life. After his third DWI, he had a choice between jail and treatment. He chose treatment with his faith, with his friends, with our family. In his words, he was pursued by grace. That made me interested in public service, because I feel like everyone should have that same right to be pursued by grace. Then got married. My husband’s out there somewhere, hopefully smiling, and our daughter. Our daughter was born, I had this expectation, we were going to have this perfect, perfect birth. She was really sick, and she couldn’t swallow. She was in and out of hospitals for a year and a half. But when she was born, they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours. She was in intensive care, and I was kicked out. I thought this could never happen to any other mom again.",Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"So, I went to the legislature, our state legislator, not an elected official, a mom, and I advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48 hour hospital stay. When they tried to delay the implementation of that law, I brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumbered the lobbyist two to one. When they said, “When should it take place?”, they all raised their hand and said, “Now.”",Sept
Amy Klobuchar,"That is what motivated me to go into public service. When I got to that gridlock of Washington DC and got to work and pass over a hundred bills … I know a lot of my friends here are from the Left, but remember I am from the middle of the country. I believe if we’re going to get things done that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit. Someone’s going to not just change the policies but change the tone in the country and someone who believes in America and believes it from their heart because of where they came from, that everyone should have that same opportunity.",Sept
George S.,"Senator, thank you. Secretary Castro.",Sept
Julian Castro,"Thank you, George, to hold head to Linsey and to David and to all of you all for tuning in tonight. In many ways, I shouldn’t be here on this stage. Castro is my mother’s name and was my grandmother’s name before her. I grew up in a single parent household on the West side of San Antonio going to the public schools. Eventually my brother, Joaquin, and I became the first in our family to become professionals.",Sept
Julian Castro,"When I got home, I took a job at the biggest law firm in town. I was making $100,000 a year in the year 2000. A few months later, I got elected to the San Antonio City Council. The city council at the time was only paying $1,040 a year. So, everybody had another job, and my job was at the law firm. Well, a few months after I got elected, the law firm got a client. The client wanted those of us on the city council to vote for a land deal. The land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply, because we relied on an underground aquifer. I didn’t think the environmental protection plan was strong enough, so I wanted to vote against it and my constituents wanted me to vote against it. But under the ethics rules for lawyers in Texas, because believe it or not, lawyers have ethics rules, you can’t just go against the interests of a client. So, I was stuck.",Sept
Julian Castro,"On the one hand, I wanted to do the right thing. On the other hand, my livelihood, my student loans, my new house payment, my car payment depended on me shutting up, being conflicted out. So, one day I walked into my law firm and I quit my job and then I went and I voted against that land deal on the city council.",Sept
Julian Castro,"It was the first test that I had. I think back to that because oftentimes we think of politics and you think of politics is dirty or corrupting. I wondered before I went into it whether it would change who I was. I was proud that when that first test came that I stood up for the people that I was there to represent and not for big special interests. There’s nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the President of the United States. This President has failed that test, but I want you to know that if you elect me president, I won’t. I won’t serve anybody except you and your family. Together we can create an America that’s better than ever. Thank you very much.",Sept

Anderson Cooper,"It’s the CNN, New York Times Democratic presidential debate. We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and watching around the world, watching us on CNN, CNN International, CNN Espanol, cnn.com, thenewyorktimes.com CNN, CNN’s Facebook page, and listening on the Westworld One Radio Network, Sirius XM satellite radio, NPR, and the American Forces Network. I’m Anderson Cooper moderating tonight’s debate along with CNN’s Erin Burnett and New York Times national editor, Marc Lacey. We are in Ohio tonight because it’s one of the most critical battleground states. Ohio has backed all but two presidential winners in every election since 1896.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"The top 12 democratic presidential candidates are at their positions behind the podiums. This is a record number of candidates for a presidential primary debate. So to accommodate the large group, there are no opening statements tonight.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Before we begin a reminder of the ground rules, you’ll each receive 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 seconds for clarifications. Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates as that will count against your time.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"And we remind our audience here in the Rike Center at Otterbein to be respectful so the candidates can hear the questions and each other. All right, let’s begin. Since the last debate House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support. Senator Warren, I want to start with you. You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate?",Oct
Senator Warren,"Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. And I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment, but when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown to a fare thee well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result, Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. You know, we took a constitutional oath and that is that no one is above the law and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump, but understand it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Thank you, Senator Warren. You’re all going to get in on this by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any choice but to impeach President Trump? Please respond.",Oct
Bernie Sanders,"No they don’t. In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. It’s not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller report. I think that the House will find him guilty of worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that and that is outrageous. And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a President of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward, by the way, not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Vice President Biden, during the Clinton impeachment proceedings you said, and I quote, “The American people don’t think that they’ve made a mistake by electing Bill Clinton and we in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision.” With the country now split, have Democrats been careful enough in pursuing the impeachment of President Trump?",Oct
Joe Biden,"Yes, they have. I said from the beginning that if in fact Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller report. If they did that, they would have no choice, no choice, but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information. This president and I agree with Bernie, Senator Sanders, is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this President of United States has gone so far as to say since this latest event that in fact he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Senator Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that members of Congress have to be in her words, “fair to the President and give him a chance to exonerate himself.” You’ve already said that based on everything you’ve seen, you would vote to remove him from office. Is that being fair to the President?",Oct
Kamala Harris,"Well, it’s just being observant because he has committed crimes in plain sight. I mean, it’s shocking, but he told us who he was. Maya Angelou who told us years ago, listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time. During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people. He’s been selling out working people. He’s been selling out our values, he’s been selling out national security and on this issue with Ukraine, he’s been selling out our democracy. Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must ask but the reality of it is that I don’t really think this impeachment process is going to take very long because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it.",Oct
Kamala Harris,"And and he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence and he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server and there has been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is indeed the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Senator Booker, you have said that president Trump’s “moral vandalism disqualifies him from being president.” Can you be fair in an impeachment trial? Please respond.",Oct
Senator Booker,"So first of all, we must be fair. We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office. This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship. Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage. I understand the outrage that we all feel, but we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn’t rip us apart. Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus. That’s what this nation needs in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a Senator, do my duty. This president has violated his, I will do mine.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Thank you, Senator Booker. Senator Klobuchar, what do you say to those who fear that impeachment is a distraction from issues that impact people’s day to day lives, healthcare, the economy and could backfire on Democrats.",Oct
Amy Klobuchar,"We can do two things at once, that’s our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America because this President has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests. He has not been standing up for the workers of Ohio. He’s not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa. And I take this even a step further. You know when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he’s digging up dirt on an opponent, that’s illegal conduct. That’s what he was doing. He didn’t talk to them about the Russian invasion, he talked to him about that. So I’m still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again. I’d like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again.",Oct
Amy Klobuchar,"And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again. It doesn’t make America great again, it makes Russia great again. And that is what this President has done. So whether it is worker’s issues, whether it is farmer’s issue, he has put his own private interests and I will not do that.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Thank you. Secretary Castro, is impeachment of distraction?",Oct
Julian Castro,"Not at all. We can walk and chew gum at the same time and all of us are out there every single day talking about what we’re going to do to make sure that more people cross the graduation stage, that more families have great healthcare, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio, where Donald Trump has broken his promises. Because Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them. Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller report point out 10 different instances where the President obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is ongoingly, in an ongoing way, violating his oath of office and abusing his power. We have to impeach this President and the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal, he should be removed.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Mayor Buttigieg, you have said that impeachment should be bipartisan. There’s been obviously very little Republican support to date, yet Democrats are proceeding. Is that a mistake?",Oct
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, it’s a mistake on the part of Republicans who enabled a president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share. Look, the President has left the Congress with no choice and this is not just about holding the President accountable for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It’s also about the presidency itself because a president, 10 years or 100 years from now, will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion, either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything. But everyone on this stage by definition is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end. I want you to picture what it’s going to be like, what it’s actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president.",Oct
Pete Buttigieg,"It starts out feeling like a happy thought. This particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over, but really think about where we’ll be, vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues, from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process. I’m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Congresswoman Gabbard, you’re the only sitting House member on this stage, how do you respond?",Oct
Tulsi Gabbard,"If impeachment is driven by these hyper-partisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country. Unfortunately, this is what we’ve already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election. And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016. The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House and I think that it should continue to play its course out together. All the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward. If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Thank you, Congresswoman. Mr. Steyer, you’ve been calling for impeachment for two years, does there need to be bipartisan support?",Oct
Tom Steyer,"Well, Anderson, this is my first time on this stage, so I just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent, and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House. But I also want to point out that Anderson’s right, two years ago, I started the Need To Impeach movement because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. That we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So in fact, impeaching and removing this President is something that the American people are demanding. They’re the voice that counts and that’s who I went to, the American people.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Mr. Yang, do you think there’s already enough evidence out there to impeach the President? Please respond.",Oct
Andrew Yang,"I support impeachment, but we shouldn’t have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will one be successful or two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016. We’re standing in the great state of Ohio, the ultimate purple state, the ultimate bellwether state. Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points? Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns and we’re not stopping there. How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio? Raise your hands. It’s not just you, Amazon alone as closing 30% of America’s stores in malls soaking up $20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes. These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected, the fourth industrial revolution and that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office. The fact is, Donald Trump, when we’re talking about him, we are losing. We need to present a new vision and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Congressman O’Rourke, on impeachment, please respond.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"You know, I think about everyone who’s ever served this country in uniform. We have two examples here on the stage tonight, Mayor Buttigieg and Congresswoman Gabbard. Those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our constitution. We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice and we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this President’s criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation. Then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Thank you, Congressman.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"If you do not hold them to account, if there is not justice, not only have we failed this moment, our constitution and our country, we have failed everyone who has sacrificed and laid their lives down on the line and we cannot do that.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Thank you, Congressman. The impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump’s attempts to get political dirt from Ukraine on Vice President Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you. Having said that on Sunday, you announced that if you’re president, no one in your family or associated with you will be involved in any foreign businesses. My question is, if it’s not okay for a president’s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it okay for your son when you were vice president, Vice President Biden?",Oct
Joe Biden,"Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that’s what we should be focusing on. And what I wanted to make a point about and my son’s statement speaks for itself, he spoke about it today. My son’s statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it’s so important to remove this man from office. On the 17th … look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president, that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections. It was the greatest threat to America.",Oct
Joe Biden,"This president on three occasions, three occasions has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the President and his thugs have already proven that they in fact are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn’t want me to be the candidate. He’s going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Hold on, I’m sorry. I just want follow up. Mr. Vice President, as you’ve said to your son, Hunter today gave an interview. He admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgment by serving on that board in Ukraine. Did you make a mistake by letting him, you were the point person on Ukraine at the time? If you can answer.",Oct
Joe Biden,"Look, my son’s statement speaks for itself. I did my job, I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We’ve always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed any, so there’d be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I’m proud of the judgment he made. I’m proud of what he had to say and let’s focus on this, the fact of the matter is that this is about Trump’s corruption. That’s what we should be focusing on.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Senator Sanders, your response.",Oct
Bernie Sanders,Let me make a point. I think that it is absolutely imperative to go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster if the American people believed that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we’re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under insured. We’re forgetting about the existential threat of climate change. We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. So what we have got to do is end this corruption set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way. But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.,Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Senator Sanders, thank you, Mark.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"We want to move now now to the economy, Senator Warren,  You’ve proposed some sweeping plans, free public college …  Thank you.",Oct
Senator Booker,It is wrong to move on.,Oct
Marc Lacey,"Senator Warren, you’ve proposed some sweeping plans, free public college, free universal child care, eliminating most Americans college debt, and you’ve said how you’re going to pay for those plans, but you have not specified how you’re going to pay for the most expensive plan, Medicare for All. Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?",Oct
Senator Warren,"So I have made clear what my principles are here and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hardworking, middle class families, costs will go down. You know, the way I see this is I have been out all around this country. I’ve done 140 town halls now. Been to 27 States and Puerto Rico, shoot, I have done 70,000 selfies, which must be the new measure of democracy. And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. So I’ve talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter’s been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I’ve talked to the young man who has M.S. And here’s the thing about all of them, they all had great health insurance right at the beginning. But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.",Oct
Senator Warren,"Look, the way I see this, it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer. To think about the changes in your family, if your mom’s got diabetes or what it means for your life going forward if you’ve been diagnosed with M.S. But what you shouldn’t have to worry about is how you’re going to pay for your healthcare after that.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All. You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it too?",Oct
Senator Warren,"So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy, they will go up for big corporations and for middle class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been “evasive” about how she’s going to pay for Medicare for All. What’s your response?",Oct
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature Senator, is to have a plan for everything except this, no plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is we really can deliver healthcare for every American and move forward with the boldest, biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself. But the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes or no question is Medicare for All who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we let you access it if you want to. And if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that too. That is what most Americans want. Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your healthcare and for your family. And it can be delivered without",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Mayor. Senator, your response.",Oct
Senator Warren,"So let’s be clear, whenever someone hears the term Medicare for All who want it, understand what that really means. It’s Medicare for All who can afford it, and that’s the problem we’ve got. Medicare for All is the gold standard. It is the way we get healthcare coverage for every single American, including the family whose child’s been diagnosed with cancer, including the person who’s just gotten an M.S. diagnosis. That’s how we make sure that everyone gets healthcare. We can pay for this, I’ve laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy, they’re going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle class families and I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs because costs are what people care about. I’ve been studying this for the biggest part of my life, why people go bankrupt.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Senator, can the mayor respond?",Oct
Senator Warren,Sure.,Oct
Pete Buttigieg,"I don’t think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice and the choice of Medicare for All who want it, which is affordable for everyone because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that healthcare. It’s just better than Medicare for All whether you want it or not. And I don’t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years, when we could achieve that same big bold goal. And once again, we’re competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized even more than now. After everything we’ve been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided. Why unnecessarily divide this country over healthcare when there’s a better way to deliver coverage for all.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Mayor, Senator Sanders.",Oct
Senator Warren,I’d like to be able to respond-,Oct
Bernie Sanders,"As somebody who wrote the damn bill as I said. Let’s be clear on the Medicare for All bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone. All out of pocket expenses are gone. We’re going to do better than the Canadian’s doing, that is what they have managed to do. At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their healthcare bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less, substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out of pocket expenses.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the Senator just said about taxes going up?",Oct
Senator Warren,"My view on this and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking middle class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for All who can afford it, that will leave behind millions of people who cannot. And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, “Sorry, we’re not covering your expensive cancer treatments. We’re not covering your expensive treatments for M.S. We’re not covering what covering what you need.”",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar.",Oct
Amy Klobuchar,"At least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up and I’m sorry Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice. I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning and that’s have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies. That is what we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in four years. And I’m tired of hearing whenever I say these things, “Oh, it’s Republican talking points.” You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan that’s going to do that. I think there is a better way that is bold that will cover more people and it’s the one we should get behind.",Oct
Marc Lacey,Senator Warren.,Oct
Senator Warren,"Yeah, I didn’t spend most of my time in Washington. I spent most of my time studying one basic question and that is why hardworking people go broke. And one of the principle reasons for that is the cost of healthcare. And back when I was studying it, two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance. The problem we’ve got right now is the overall cost of healthcare. And look, you can try to spin this any way you want. I’ve spent my entire life on working on how America’s middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we’ve got stop Americans from going bankrupt over healthcare costs.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar, do you want to respond?",Oct
Amy Klobuchar,"Yes I do and I appreciate Elizabeth’s work. But again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done and we can get this public option done and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers me about this discussion, which we’ve had so many times, is that we don’t talk about the things that I’m hearing about from regular Americans that is longterm care. We are seeing, I once called it a silver tsunami, the aging, and then someone told me that was too negative. So I call it the silver surge, the aging of the population. We need to make it easier to get longterm care insurance and strengthen Medicaid. In this state, the state of Ohio that has been hit by the opioid epidemic, we need to take on those pharma companies and make them pay for the addictions that they have caused and the people that they have killed. Those are the issues that I hear about when I’m in Toledo",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Let me bring you in here, Vice President, for your response. Are Senators Warren and Sanders being realistic about the difficulty of enacting their plans?",Oct
Joe Biden,"First of all, the plan we’re hearing discussed is the Biden plan, the one I put forward, build on Obamacare, at public option. We can go into that, I can talk about that if you’d like. But here’s the deal, on the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it’s awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget and we talk about how we’re going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs, but for people making between $50 and $75,000 year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000 because the fact is they’ll pay more in new taxes, 7.4% plus or 5% plus a 4% income tax. If a fireman and a schoolteacher are making 100,000 bucks a year, their taxes are going to go up about 10 grand. That is more than they will possibly say on this healthcare plan. We have a plan put forward that will work.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Senator Sanders, do you want to respond to that?",Oct
Bernie Sanders,"I get a little bit tired, I must say, of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel. 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt. For what reason, they came down with cancer. I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the healthcare industry, which made $100 billion in profit. Whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt price fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. And if we don’t have the guts to do that, if all we could do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Harris, your response.",Oct
Kamala Harris,"This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word with all of these discussions about healthcare on women’s access to reproductive healthcare, which it’s under full on attack in America today, and it’s outrageous. There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare. And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies. Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women’s bodies and let women make the-",Oct

Erin Burnett,"I want to turn now to jobs. According to a recent study, about a quarter of American jobs could be lost to automation in just the next 10 years. Ohio is one of the states likely to be hardest hit. Senator Sanders, you say your federal jobs guarantee is part of the answer to the threat from automation, but tens of millions of Americans could end up losing their jobs. Are you promising that you will have a job for every single one of those Americans?",Oct
Bernie Sanders,"Damn right, we will, and I’ll tell you why. If you look up what goes on in America today, we have an infrastructure which is collapsing. We can put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, airports, et cetera. Furthermore, and I hope we will discuss it at length tonight, this planet faces the greatest threat in its history from climate change, and the Green New Deal that I have advocated will create up to 20 million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. We need workers to do childcare. We need workers, great teachers to come in to school systems which don’t have the teachers that we need right now. We need more doctors, we need more dentists, we need more carpenters, we need more sheet metal metalworkers. When we talk about making public colleges and universities tuition-free and canceling student debt, we’re going to give those people the opportunity to get those good jobs.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Senator Sanders, thank you. Mr. Yang, your main solution to job loss from automation is a universal basic income. Why is giving people $1,000 a month better than Sanders’ plan guaranteeing them a job?",Oct
Andrew Yang,"I am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee, but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice. What are the jobs? Who manages you? What if you don’t like your job? What if you’re not good at your job? The fact is, most Americans do not want to work for the federal government and saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century, to me, is not a vision that most Americans would embrace.",Oct
Andrew Yang,"Also, Senator Sanders’ description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife, who’s at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic. We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month. It actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities. It helps all Americans transition, because the fact is, and you know this in Ohio, if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources, you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants. When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy from our people, our families, and our communities up. It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do. This is the sort of positive vision in response to the Fourth Industrial Revolution that we have to embrace as a party.",Oct

I just want to say, as a great New Jerseyan, Yogi Berra, said, “I am having deja vu all over again.” I’m having days of Google all over again, first of all, because I saw this play in 2016’s election. We are literally using Donald Trump’s lies, and the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. He should not have to defend ourselves. The only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump, seeing that we’re distracting from his malfeasance and the selling out of his office.",Oct

Erin Burnett,"Senator, thank you. We are going to get to that issue later on tonight. Senator Warren, you wrote that blaming job loss on automation is “a good story, except it’s not really true.” Should workers here in Ohio not be worried about losing their jobs to automation?",Oct
Senator Warren,"The data show that we’ve had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principle reason has been bad trade policy. The principle reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who have been calling the shots on trade, giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line.",Oct
Senator Warren,"I have a plan to fix that, and it’s accountable capitalism. It says, “You want to have one of the giant corporations in America? Then, by golly, 40% of your board of directors should be elected by your employees.” That’ll make a difference. When a corporation decides, “Gee, we can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico,” when there are people on the board in the board room saying, “No. Do you know what that does to our company? Do you know what that does to our community, what it does to our workers?” We also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate. We need to restructure strength in this economy and that’s where it starts.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro. What’s your response to Senator Warren’s claim that automation is a good story, except it’s not really true?",Oct
Julian Castro,"Well, I think what folks have said is that that is only part of the issue, right? Yeah, I believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation. I’m even willing to pilot something like UBI and to see how that would work, but I think we need to focus on making sure that we spark job opportunity for people across this country. As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio, in the latest job data, Ohio is losing jobs under Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to Ohio and the industrial Midwest. I would invest in infrastructure to put people back to work. I would invest in a Green New Deal to unleash millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy.",Oct

They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonald’s, every grocery store, every CVS. Driving a truck as the most common job in 29 States, including this one. Three and a half million truck drivers in this country, and my friends in California are piloting self driving trucks. What does that going to mean for the three and a half million truckers or the seven million Americans who work in truck stops, motels, and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal?

It’s one of the reasons that I put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add $200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now. That $200 a month will lift nearly 5 million families out of poverty and it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more.

They don’t know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives. I agree with my friend Andrew Yang. I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see. This has to do with bad trade deals that we’ve seen in the past, that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families. Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the American people. I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that. The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have, but is intrinsic to who we all are as Americans, whatever we choose to do with our lives, and we can’t forget that.",Oct

Marc Lacey,"One of the industries most at risk from a changing economy is the auto industry. General Motors used to be the largest employer in Ohio. Now it’s 72nd. Today, thousands of GM workers here in Ohio and across the country are on strike. All of you on the stage have voiced support for these workers. Senator Booker, one of the latest impasses in negotiations involves bringing jobs back from Mexico. As president, how would you convince GM to return production to the United States?",Oct
Senator Booker,"Well, first of all, the one point I wanted to make about the UBI conversation, and I hope that my friend Andrew Yang will come out for this… Doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It would put more money in people’s pockets than giving them $1,000 a month. We have to start putting the dignity back in work. Number one, you start having trade deals. Not like this thing that the president is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesn’t put workers at the center of every trade deal. We must make sure we are not giving corporate tax incentives for people to move jobs out of our country, but start to put the worker at the center of that and make sure that they have the resources to succeed.",Oct
Senator Booker,"But it’s more than that. I stood with these workers because we’re seeing this trend all over our country. I stood with unions because right now, unions in America are under attack. As union membership has gone down, we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country. So the other thing that I’ll do as president of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread, to make sure we have sectorial bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers’ conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you. Senator. Congressman O’Rourke, same question for you. How would you convince GM to bring production back to the United States from Mexico?",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"I’ve met with these members of the UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio, which has just been devastated, decimated by GM and their malfeasance, paying effectively zero in taxes last year. The people of Ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure around there, what they want is a shot. They want fairness in how we treat workers in this country, which they are not receiving today.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"Part of the way to do that is through our trade deals, making sure that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions, which they are effectively unable to do today. Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker, it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage. If we compliment that with investment in world-class pre K through 12 public education, get behind our world-class public school educators, if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college, and if we elevate the role of unions in this country and create more than five million apprenticeships over the next eight years, we will make sure that every single American has a shot. They don’t want a handout, they don’t want a job guarantee. They just want a shot, and as president, I will give them that shot.",Oct

Erin Burnett,"Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate. The top 1% now own more of this nation’s wealth than the bottom 90% combined. Senator Sanders, when you introduced your wealth tax, which would tax the assets of the wealthiest Americans, you said, quoting you, Senator, ” Billionaires should not exist.” Is the goal of your plan to tax billionaires out of existence?",Oct
Bernie Sanders,"When you have a half a million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have 87 million people uninsured or under-insured, when you’ve got hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt, and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage. The truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality and we cannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years. If you are asking me, do I think we should demand that the wealthy start paying… the wealthiest, top one-tenth of 1%… start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us? Yes, that’s exactly what I believe.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Thank you. Senator. Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage.",Oct
Tom Steyer,Ha.,Oct
Erin Burnett,What’s your plan for closing the income gap?,Oct
Tom Steyer,"Well, first of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people, and specifically on organized labor. The results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It’s absolutely wrong. It’s absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations.",Oct
Tom Steyer,"But there’s something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that’s the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise. 90% of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It’s seven and a quarter. If you included the productivity gains of American workers, it’d be over 20 bucks. There’s something wrong here, and that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That’s why I’m running for president, because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants… healthcare, education, Green New Deal, or a living wage-",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer.",Oct
Tom Steyer,#NAME?,Oct
Erin Burnett,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders’ and Senator Warren’s wealth tax plans do that?",Oct
Joe Biden,"No, look. Demonizing wealthy people. What I talked about is how you get things done. The way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. We have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax that… I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5%. I would double it, because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who’s clipping coupons in the stock market make… in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is… like I said, a school teacher and a firefighter. It’s ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax.",Oct
Joe Biden,"Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are there’s $1 trillion, $640 billion in tax loopholes. You can’t justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We can eliminate it all. I could go into detail, had I the time. Thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We’re going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody’s right about the fact that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed. If they’re going back, they’re not investing in their employees. They’re reinvesting and buying back their stock.",Oct

Joe Biden,"See, I’m doing the same thing.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Senator Warren, your response.",Oct
Senator Warren,"I think this is about our values as a country. Show me your budget, show me your tax plans, and we’ll know what your values are. Right now in America, the top one tenth of 1% have so much wealth, understand this, that if we put a two-cent tax on their 50,000,001st dollar and on every dollar after that, we would have enough money to provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five, universal pre-K for every child, raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America, provide for universal tuition-free college, put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities-",Oct

Washington politicians, congressmen, and senators saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes. I didn’t even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that I would see out the windows of my dad’s Chevy Cavalier when he drove me to school. I didn’t know that wasn’t every city until I went away to college. Now I drive my own Chevy. It’s a Chevy Cruze. Used to be built right in Lordstown, which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers. But why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place? It’s because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything, and while he’s unquestionably made it dramatically worse, this is time to realize that we’re paying attention to the wrong things. We’re paying attention-",Oct

Amy Klobuchar,"It could work. I am open to it, but I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea. When I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, “Guess what, you guys all got a lot richer.” That was the one time in his presidency he told the truth. We have different ways. I would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that helped the rich, including what he did with the corporate tax rate, including what he did on international taxation. You add it all up, you got a lot of money that one, helps pay for that childcare, protects that dignity of work, makes sure we have decent retirement and makes sure that our kids can go to good schools.",Oct
Erin Burnett,Thank you.,Oct
Amy Klobuchar,It is not one idea that rules here.,Oct
Erin Burnett,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Warren, please respond.",Oct
Senator Warren,"Understand, taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way tax and wealth does, that the rich are not like you and me. The really, really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth and it just keeps growing. We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation. Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.",Oct
Amy Klobuchar,"Oh, I would like to respond to that.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Senator Klobuchar. Respond, please.",Oct
Amy Klobuchar,"I think simply because you have different ideas doesn’t mean you’re fighting for regular people. I wouldn’t even be up on this stage if it wasn’t for unions and the dignity of work. If my grandpa didn’t have unions protecting him in those mines, he wouldn’t have survived. If my mom didn’t have unions as a teacher, she wouldn’t have been able to make the wages she made when my parents got divorced. Just because we have different ideas and get to the same place in terms of beating Donald Trump and taking this on… We are in Ohio, we can win Ohio and the presidency, but only if we unite, if we unite around ideals and don’t go fighting against each other, and instead take the fight to him.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Harris, you want to give working families a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year to help close the income gap.",Oct
Kamala Harris,Right.,Oct
Erin Burnett,Is that a better solution than a wealth tax?,Oct
Kamala Harris,"Well, here’s how I think about it. When I was growing up, my mother raised my sister and me. We would often come home from school before she came home from work. She’d come home, she’d cook dinner, and at some point we’d go to bed and she’d sit up at the kitchen table, trying to figure out how to make it all work. When I think about where we are right now in 2020, I do believe justices on the ballot. It’s on the ballot in terms of impeachment. It’s on the ballot in terms of economic justice, health justice, and so many other issues. When I think about this issue, I’m thinking about that dad, who tonight is going to be sitting his kitchen table after everyone’s gone to sleep, and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee, trying to figure out how he’s going to make it work. He’s probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month, he’s going to have to start driving an Uber.",Oct
Kamala Harris,"What does that mean? That means that with those two jobs, he’s going to miss his kids’ soccer games. That’s the reality for Americans today, which is why yes, when I get elected and and pass this bill, which will give the American family who makes less than $100,000 a year a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year that they can take home at up to $500 a month, that’s going to make a real difference in that man’s life. Don’t tell him that’s not a big deal-",Oct

Kamala Harris,#NAME?,Oct
Erin Burnett,"Mr. Yang, your response. Would you oppose a wealth tax?",Oct
Andrew Yang,"Senator Warren is 100% right that we’re in the midst of the most extreme winner-take-all economy in history, and a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is that it’s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all of those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they’d projected. If we can’t learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countries’ mistakes. Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax. If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands, because we know best how to use it.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Thank you. Thank you. Congressman O’Rourke, do you think a wealth tax is the best way to address income inequality? Your response.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up, and sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other, instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions. I think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas, Nevada. She’s working four jobs, raising her child with disabilities. Any American with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and get by in this country already. Some of those jobs working for some of these corporations.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"She wants to know how we are going to help her. How we’re going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs, that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities, that she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage. Senator Warren said, “Show me your budget, show me your tax plan, and you’ll show me your values.” She has yet to describe her tax plan and whether or not that person I met would see a tax increase. Under my administration, if you make less than $250,000 a year as a family, you will not see a tax increase. That family needs to know that.",Oct

But you built that fortune in America, I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for.

I grew up with my twin brother walking in a single parent household where my mom was working hard to support us and also her mom, my grandmother, and we knew what it was like a to wonder whether we’re going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month or sometimes have the electricity turned off and when I was a kid to look at the grocery list that seemed to get shorter and shorter and that’s what’s happening to a lot of families these days.",Oct

How we talk about each other in this debate actually, really matters. I’ve had the privilege of working with or being friends with everybody on this stage, and tearing each other down because we have a different plan, to me, is unacceptable.

We have a lot of work to do there, but we’ve had 20 years of presidential debates and we have never talked about the violence in America of child poverty. We have got to begin to talk more eloquently and more persuasively and urgently about doing the things not just to make sure a fair taxes are paid by people on the top, but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world.

President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all American forces from Northern Syria, abandoning America’s longtime Kurdish allies.

It won’t affect us.” It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history, excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I’ve never seen a time, and I spent thousands of hours in the situation room, I’ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders, across the board, former and present are ashamed of what’s happening here.",Oct
Joe Biden,"What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, he’s going to have a problem because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan, and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now, pay that price.",Oct

They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful what this man has done.",Oct

Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up too.

The crisis here, as I think Joe said and Pete said, is when you begin to betray people … And in terms of the Kurds, 11,000 of them died fighting ISIS, 20,000 were wounded. And the United States said, “We are with you. We’re standing with you.” And then suddenly one day, after a phone call with Erdogan, announced by tweet, Trump reverses that policy. Now you tell me, what country in the world will trust the word of the President of the United States? In other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Thank you, Senator-",Oct

Remember, the problem right now is not just with our competitors. In for example, a place like China, the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy, and don’t get a peep of support from the President. It’s not just the behavior of adversaries like Russia, but our one-time allies like Saudi Arabia, which the CIA just concluded was responsible, as we all knew, for murdering and dismembering an American resident and journalist, and Turkey, which was an American ally. That’s the point. We had leverage, but when we abandoned the international stage, when we think our only choices are between endless war or total isolation, the consequence is-",Oct

This is an outrageous thing that happened here, and I think we need to talk about this a not only in terms of the horror of what happened here with Turkey, but the fact that our President blew it, and now he’s too proud to say it, and what do we do now? We continue that humanitarian aid, but then we work with our allies to say, “Come back, Turkey, and stop this.” Because what Mayor Pete has just said is true. Think about our other allies, Israel. How do they feel right now? Donald Trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the Mid-East.

Anderson Cooper,"Secretary Castro, your response?",Oct
Julian Castro,"Well, I mean you asked the question of how are we going to get people to trust us again? The first thing is we’ve got to boot Donald Trump out of the Oval Office so that people will trust us again. You know, I also want people to think, the folks this week that saw those images of ISIS prisoners running free, to think about how absurd it is that this President is caging kids on the border, and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free. He has made a tremendous mistake, a total disaster there in Syria.",Oct
Julian Castro,"And just to connect the dots for a second, if you’re Kim Jong Un, for instance, why in the world would you believe anything that this President says to contain your nuclear weapons program when he tore up an Iran nuclear agreement that we just signed four years ago, which was the strongest agreement to contain Iran’s nuclear weapons program, and now he’s abandoned the very people that we gave our word to?",Oct

Anderson Cooper,"Thank you, Mr. Secretary.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Senator Booker, the American Intelligence community says that Russia is trying to capitalize on the power vacuums around the world as we’re seeing right now in Northern Syria. What specifically would you do as President to check Vladimir Putin’s power on the world stage?",Oct
Senator Booker,"So first of all, understand that this president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire. We literally have great generals, like Mattis, who said on the world stage, “The United States of America. There can be no better friend than the United States of America, and no greater enemy than the United States of America.” This President has turned that upside down, and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances, and partner with Russia.",Oct
Senator Booker,"And so clearly, to your question, number one, we cannot allow the Russians to continue to grow and influence by abandoning the world stage. We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine, and Latvia, and Lithuania, but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable. Russia and Putin understand strength, and this President, time and time again, is showing moral weakness.",Oct
Senator Booker,"He makes promises to the American people, that he’s going to protect this nation. Well, instead of doing something to defeat ISIS, he’s now given them a foothold again. This is an American President that even right now is lying to the American public and saying he’s bringing our troops home. At the same time, he’s increasing true presence with the Saudis while they’re involved in an unjust war that is killing tens of thousands of children in Yemen. This president is making us less safe. He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron. As President of the United States, I will stop this and restore American integrity abroad.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Senator. Vice President?",Oct
Joe Biden,"I think I may be, doesn’t make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin, as well as with Erdogan. And Erdogan understands that … You talk about should he stay in or out of NATO? He understands that he’s out of NATO, he’s in real trouble. But the fact of the matter is we have been one willing in this administration because we have an erratic, crazy President who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy, and operates out of fear for his own reelection. Think what’s happened. The fact of the matter is you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO. What does the president do? He says, “I believe Vladimir Putin. I don’t believe our intelligence community.”",Oct
Bernie Sanders,Are you suggesting I’m Vladimir Putin?,Oct
Joe Biden,"No, no, I’m not. No, no, I’m not. I’m not. I’m not.",Oct
Bernie Sanders,I know.,Oct
Joe Biden,"I’m not. But here, look, but here’s the deal. Think what that did. He turns around, and he questions whether or not he’ll keep the sacred commitment of Article 5 for the NATO members. If he is reelected, I promise you, there will be no NATO. Our security will be vastly underrated, under … We will be in real trouble.",Oct
Joe Biden,"And with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy, we’d change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds and thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border. And lastly, and I apologize for going up, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to, I mean excuse me, in Afghanistan as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS, it’s going to come here. They are going to, in fact, damage the United States of America. That’s why we got involved in the first place, and not ceded the whole area to Assad and to the Russians.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Congressman O’Rourke, Senate Democrats put out a report last year on Russia’s hostile actions around the world. They suggest the next president could fight back by publicly revealing what the U.S. knows about Putin’s corruption, and work with allies to freeze his bank accounts. Would you take either of those actions, even in the face of possible retaliation?",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"Yes, we must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold Russia accountable for invading the world’s greatest democracy, and being able to do it, thanks to Donald Trump, functionally, with impunity so far, so much so that they are invading this democracy right now, as we speak, still at the invitation of this President. So if there are not consequences, we will continue to see this problem going forward.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"But in addition, , to answer the previous question that you asked, how do we stand up to Russia on the global stage? We do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships. That is what makes America stronger. There isn’t enough money in this country, there aren’t enough service members, as brave and courageous as they are, to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"And the Kurds are case in point. In fact, because we turned our backs on them, those Kurds who fought for us in Syria, helped to defeat ISIS, not just for themselves, but for the United States of America, it makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of service members to fight those battles there.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"one of intimidation and one of inspiration. We need to now focus on that latter power, and make sure that we invest in diplomacy in our State Department, and peacefully and non-violently resolving our foreign policy goals.

But making sure that our diplomats are invested in, have the focus necessary by this next president to make sure that they can accomplish those goals for this country and for the world.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Congressman. Mr. Steyer, would you publicly reveal what the U.S. knows about Putin’s corruption or work to freeze his bank accounts? Please respond.",Oct
Tom Steyer,"Absolutely. As far as I’m concerned, Mr. Trump’s America first program, which involves having no plans, having no process, and having no partners is proved to be a disaster in Syria, it’s proved to be a disaster in terms of our response to Russia’s attacking our democracy, and more than that, when we look at the problems around the world, the idea that the United States is going to act unilaterally against a country without the support of our traditional allies makes absolutely no sense.",Oct
Tom Steyer,"Let’s go to the most important international problem that we’re facing, which no one has brought up, which is climate. We can’t solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves. It’s an international crisis. I’ve been working on it for 10 years, taking on the corporations. But we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world. So if you look at what Mr. Trump is doing, of course he’s been bought by the oil and gas companies. But any problem that we’re going to do, but specifically climate, we’re going to have to lead the world morally, we’re going to have to lead it technologically, financially, and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first, go it alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I’ve ever heard, and I would change it on day one in every single light.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Mr. Yang, your response to Putin and Russia?",Oct
Andrew Yang,"Of course. We have to look at the chain of events. How did we get here? The fact is, we were falling apart at home, so we voted in Donald Trump, and he’s now led us down this dangerous path with erratic and unreliable foreign policy. We have to let Russia know, “Look, we get it. We’ve tampered with other elections. You’ve tampered with our elections. And now it has to stop. And if it does not stop, we will take this as an act of hostility against the American people.” I believe most Americans would support me on this.",Oct

Vladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent, and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election. This wasn’t meddling. That’s what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she’s doing. Sorry.",Oct

And then we need to stop the social media companies from running paid political ads, including ones last time in rubles, without having to say where those ads came from and who paid for them.

Anderson Cooper,"Thank you. We want to turn back to domestic issues, in the epidemic of gun violence in this country. We’re less than 100 miles from Dayton, Ohio, where two months ago, a gunman killed nine people using an AR-15 style weapon with a high capacity magazine. Congressman O’Rourke, in the last debate you said, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” But when you were asked how you’d enforce a mandatory buyback, you said police wouldn’t be going door to door. So how exactly are you going to force people to give up their weapons? You don’t even know who has those weapons.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"Look, we’re going to make sure that the priority is saving the lives of our fellow Americans. I think almost everyone on this stage agrees that it’s not right, and as president would seek to ban the sale of AR-15s and AK-47s. Those are weapons of war. That they were designed to kill people effectively, efficiently on a battlefield. You mentioned the massacre in Dayton, nine people killed in under 40 seconds. In El Paso, Texas, 22 were killed in under three minutes. And the list goes on throughout the country.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging with 16 million AR-15s and AK-47s out there, they’re also too dangerous to own. Every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror. Just ask Hispanics in Texas, Univision surveyed them, more than 80% feared that they would be a victim of a mass terror attack like the one in El Paso that was targeted at Mexican Americans and immigrants, inspired in part by this President’s racism and hatred that he’s directed at communities like mine in El Paso.",Oct

So to be clear, exactly how are you going to take away weapons from people who do not want to give them up, and you don’t know where they are?",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, there will be other consequences from law enforcement. But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law. I believe in this country. I believe in my fellow Americans. I believe that they will do the right thing.",Oct

Pete Buttigieg,"Well, Congressman, you just made it clear that you don’t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets. If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it, but we can’t wait. People are dying in the streets right now. We can’t wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through. We can’t wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high capacity magazines so we don’t wind up with millions more of these things on the street. We can’t wait for red flag laws that are going to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides, which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country. We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Congressman O’Rourke, your response?",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"This is not a purity test. This is a country that loses 40,000 of fellow Americans every year to gun violence. This is a crisis, and we’ve got to do something about it. And those challenges that you described are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that I’m describing. I want to make sure we have universal background checks, and red flag laws, and that we end the sale of these weapons of war. But to use the analogy of healthcare, it would be as though we said, “Look, we’re for primary care, but let’s not talk about mental healthcare because that’s a bridge too far. People need that primary care now, so let’s save that for another day.” No, let’s decide what we are going to believe in, what we are going to achieve, and then let’s bring this country together in order to do that.

Beto O’Rourke,"That’s a mischaracterization. Anderson, I’ve got answered this. Never took you or anyone else on who disagrees with me on this issue. But when you, Mayor Buttigieg, described this policy as a shiny object, I don’t care what that meant to me or my candidacy, but to those who have survived gun violence, those who’ve lost a loved one to an AR-15, an AK-47. March For Our Lives formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics, and poll-tested politicians. That was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups, and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR-15 and an AK-47. We must buy them back.",Oct

I met one of those survivors from that shooting. 30 seconds, nine people killed. The public is with us on this in a big way. The majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks right now. The majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation. There are three bills right now on Mitch McConnell’s desk. The background check bill. My bill to close the boyfriend loophole so domestic abusers don’t get guns. The bill to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun. That’s what we should be focusing on. And I just don’t want to screw this up. When I’m president, I do want to bring in an assault weapon ban and I do want to put a limitation on magazines so what happened in Dayton, Ohio will never happen again, but let’s not mess this up with this fight.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Senator Warren, you support a voluntary gun buyback of assault style weapons, as well. Why not a mandatory one?",Oct
Senator Warren,"Look, I want to get what work’s done. I want to use the method we used, for example, with machine guns. We registered them. We put in a huge penalty if you didn’t register them and a huge tax on them and let people turn them in, and it got machine guns out of the hands of people. But the problem here that we need to focus on is first how widespread gun violence is. As you’ve rightly identified, it’s not just about mass shootings, it’s what happens in neighborhoods all across this country.",Oct
Senator Warren,"It is about suicide. It is about domestic violence. This is not going to be a one and done that we do one thing or two things or three things and then we’re done. We have to reduce gun violence overall, and the question we have to ask is why hasn’t it happened? You say, we’re so close. We have been so close.

Recent studies show that mass violence went down when that occurred. The way to deal with those guns and those AR-15s and assault weapons that people own is to do what we did with the National Firearms Act as it related to machine guns. You must register that weapon. You must register it. When you register it, the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially. I’m the only one that moved to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it. I’ve done this. I know how to get it done. If you really want to get it done, go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued. That will .",Oct

Anderson Cooper,"Senator Castro, thank you.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Turning to another key issue here in Ohio and around the country, the opioid epidemic. Senator Klobuchar, CNN reached out to Ohio Democratic voters for their most pressing questions. Bri, a teacher in Proctorville asks, ” In rural Ohio, the opioid epidemic has effected our communities and schools. I have many high school students who have lost one or both parents to heroin. Teachers are on the front lines daily witnessing these tragedies. How will you tackle this problem in general, but specifically, what will you offer people in rural communities where rehabilitation is not easily accessed and access to jobs is difficult?”",Oct
Amy Klobuchar,"Well, I want to thank her for this question. This is something that should never have happened to begin with. I remember when I was a prosecutor, these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door. And it’s gotten worse and worse and we now know why. As the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits, probably one of the most horrible things that I saw was the email from one of the pharma executives that actually said, “Keep pumping them out. They’re eating them like Doritos.”",Oct
Amy Klobuchar,"So my first answer to that question, and which is included in my plan, is that the people that should pay for this, that should pay for the treatment, are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place. And that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids. That’s the first way. You can, with a 2 cents per milligram tax, bring in the money, plus with the federal master settlement, to help in rural areas where they’re so isolated, and also in urban areas where it’s, by the way, not just opioids, there are still meth issues and crack cocaine issues.",Oct
Amy Klobuchar,"This is personal for me. My dad, he struggled with alcoholism his whole life, and by his third DWI they said to him, the prosecutor, “You’ve got to face jail or you’ve got to go to treatment.” He picked treatment and he was pursued by grace. He has been sober ever since, and now he’s 91 and in assisted living. He said to me last year, “It’s hard to get a drink around here, anyway.” But he still has an AA group that visits him there. And so for me, I believe that everyone in this country, including the people in rural America, have that same right to be pursued by grace.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Senator. Mr Steyer, how would you address the opioid epidemic that exists here in Ohio and around the country? Please respond.",Oct
Tom Steyer,"Well, I think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that America’s had. 72,000 people died of opioid overdoses last year, and that’s not only a tragedy for them, it’s a tragedy for their family and their communities. And so I think we have to treat this as a health crisis. We have to move the resources and the support there to try and help people, but I think that Senator Klobuchar makes a good point. The reason I’m running for president is that we have a broken government, and we have a broken government because corporations have bought it.",Oct
Tom Steyer,"Every single one of these conversations is about that broken government. It’s about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want. It’s about the gun manufacturers buying the government and get what we want. We need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government. I’ve put forward actual structural changes, including term limits, a national referendum, the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of American citizens politically and make it a lot easier to vote. These corporations have taken over our government, and 72,000 deaths this year are the tragic result.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mr. Yang, you want to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of opioids, including heroin. How would that solve the crisis?",Oct
Andrew Yang,"That’s exactly right, and we have to recognize this is a disease of capitalism run amuck. There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio, and for some reason the federal government thought that was appropriate. They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money until you realize that company made $30 billion. They got a 2% fine and they killed tens of thousands of Americans an hour. So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our communities so our people have a fighting chance to get well. Even though this is not a money problem, we all know this is a human problem.",Oct
Andrew Yang,"Part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they’re not going to be referred to a prison cell, they will be referred to treatment and counseling. I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again, because the fact is after you save someone who’s ODing, you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week. So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use. We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing, this was a systemic government failing, and then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country because they save lives.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. Congressman O’Rourke, is decriminalizing opioids part of the solution? Please respond.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"Yes, it is, for many of the reasons that Mr. Yang just described, and also just from some personal experiences I’ve had as a member of Congress where constituents of mine have come forward, in some cases publicly, at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions. I remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the VA. Now imagine that veteran instead of being prescribed an opioid had been prescribed marijuana, because we made that legal in America, insured the VA could prescribe it, expunge the arrest records for those who have been arrested for possession, and made sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"I also want to agree with Senator Klobuchar. Until we hold those responsible accountable for their actions, Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson, we’re going to continue to have this problem going on again. So, that veteran that I met, and anyone with drug addiction today, is not a problem for the criminal justice system. They’re an opportunity for our public health system -",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Senator Harris, you want to hold the drug manufacturers that fueled the crisis accountable. Are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to jail?",Oct
Kamala Harris,"I am, and I will tell you as a former prosecutor, I do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability, because they are nothing more than some high level dope dealers. They have been engaged … and I’ve seen it happen before. I’ve taken on the pharmaceutical companies when I was Attorney General of California and led the second largest Department of Justice. I’ve seen what they do. The eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies, last year profited $72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis, which is a public health epidemic.",Oct
Kamala Harris,"And they knew what they were doing. They were marketing false advertising. They knew what they were pushing in communities and states like Ohio, without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks. And yes, they should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice. And so as as President of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department Of Justice understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal, let’s end mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs and let’s go after these pharmaceutical companies for what they’ve been doing to destroy our country in States like Ohio.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to prison? Please respond.",Oct
Julian Castro,"Yes, I am. They need to be held accountable, not only financially, but also criminal penalties. You know, you can draw a straight line between making sure that we hold executives accountable, whether it’s these drug manufacturers or Wall Street executives that should have been held accountable a decade and a half ago.",Oct
Marc Lacey,Thank you.,Oct
Erin Burnett,"Now to the issue of candidates and their health. Senator Sanders, I want to start with you. I want to start … We’re moving on, Senator, I’m sorry.",Oct
Bernie Sanders,I’m healthy. I’m feeling great. But I would like to respond to that question.,Oct
Erin Burnett,I want to start by saying …,Oct
Senator Booker,"And Senator Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana. I want to make sure that’s clear, as well.",Oct
Bernie Sanders,Thank you.,Oct
Erin Burnett,"Senator Sanders, this debate does mark your-",Oct
Bernie Sanders,I’m not on it tonight. -,Oct
Erin Burnett,"… this debate, sir, does mark your return to the campaign trail. Go ahead and finish your point and then I’ll ask my question, Senator.",Oct
Bernie Sanders,"I’m more than happy to answer your question, but I wanted to pick up on what Kamala and Cory and others have said. Let’s take a deep breath, take a look at this opioid epidemic. You have the executive CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies making tens of millions of dollars a year, and in this particular case with the opioids, they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them. Last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit. This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country, and it’s not just the drug companies. Right now, the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world, and they continue to make huge profits.",Oct
Erin Burnett,Senator-,Oct
Bernie Sanders,That is why we need a political revolution-,Oct
Erin Burnett,"Thank you, Senator.",Oct
Bernie Sanders,… that says enough is enough to this behavior.,Oct
Erin Burnett,"Senator, we are all very glad you’re feeling well, as you’ve just said, but there is a question on a lot of people’s minds and I want to address it tonight. You’re 78 years old and you just had a heart attack. How do you reassure Democratic voters that you’re up to the stress of the presidency?",Oct
Bernie Sanders,"Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we’re having in Queens, New York, berniesanders.com. We’re going to have a special guest at that event and we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people. But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I’m so happy to be back here with you this evening.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Vice President Biden, if you’re elected you will turn 80 during your first term. Last month, former President Jimmy Carter said he could not have undertaken the duties of the presidency at 80 years old. Why are you so sure that you can?",Oct
Joe Biden,"Because I’ve watched it, I know what the job is, I’ve been engaged. Look, one of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and my experience. With it, comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track. It is required now, more than any time in any of our lifetimes, to have someone who has that capacity on day one. That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because of I know what has to be done, I’ve done it before, I’ve been there.",Oct
Joe Biden,"When we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history, I’ve been there. And I’ve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act, as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act which kept us from going into depression. I know what has to be done. I will not need any on the job training the day I take office, and I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records?",Oct
Joe Biden,Before the first vote.,Oct
Erin Burnett,Before Iowa?,Oct
Joe Biden,Yes.,Oct
Erin Burnett,Not by the end of this year?,Oct
Joe Biden,"Before Iowa. I mean, look, I’ve released them before. I released 55 pages of my … I’m the only guy that’s released anything up here.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated on a first term. You’ll be 71. 40% of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?",Oct
Senator Warren,"Well, I say I will out-work, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we’re going to win is by addressing head on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they’re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. Political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don’t want to admit that.",Oct
Senator Warren,"They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it, Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people’s lives, things like childcare and healthcare and housing costs, Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Thank you, Senator warren. Congresswoman Gabbard, you’re 38 years old and you would be the youngest president if elected. Should age matter when choosing a president?",Oct
Tulsi Gabbard,"I’m glad you asked, because I was going to say it’s not fair to ask these three about their health and their fitness to serve as president, but not every other one of us. I am grateful to have been trained very well by the army and do my best to stay in shape, but here’s the real question I believe you should be asking, is who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief? This is the most important responsibility that the president has. What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him inviting Turkey to come in and slaughter the Kurds, show what an unfit president looks like it. It highlights how critical is that we have a president and commander-in-chief who’s ready on day one, bringing experience and understanding in foreign policy and national security.",Oct
Tulsi Gabbard,"Bringing the experience that I have both serving in Congress now for nearly seven years, serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, serving on the Armed Services Committee, subcommittee’s related to terrorism and upcoming threats, serving on the Homeland Security Committee. The experience that I have as a soldier, serving for over 16 years in the Army National Guard, deploying twice to the Middle East, being able to serve in different capacities, joint training exercises, training the Kuwait National Guard. I understand the importance of our national security. I am prepared to do this job to fulfill this responsibility as commander-in-chief on day one.",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Thank you, Congresswoman.",Oct
Tulsi Gabbard,"I’d like to ask our other candidates this question, I’d like to start with Senator Warren-",Oct
Erin Burnett,"Sorry, Congresswoman. I’m sorry.",Oct
Tulsi Gabbard,… what her experience and background is to serve as commander-in-chief?,Oct
Erin Burnett,I’m sorry. Thank you. We’re going to take another break now. The CNN New York Times Debate live from Otterbein University here in Ohio. We’ll be back in just a few moments.,Oct
Anderson Cooper,Welcome back to the CNN New York Times Democratic Presidential Debate. Marc Lacey from the New York Times starts off our questioning. Marc.,Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you. Let’s turn to the growing concerns over the power of big tech companies. Mr. Yang, Senator Warren is calling for companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google to be broken up. Is she right? Does that need to happen?",Oct
Andrew Yang,"As usual, Senator Warren is 100% right in diagnosing the problem. There are absolutely excesses in technology, and in some cases, having them divest parts of their business is the right move, but we also have to be realistic that competition doesn’t solve all of the problems. It’s not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app, that would be like . There’s a reason why no one is using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft, it’s true. So it’s not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive main street businesses around the country.",Oct
Andrew Yang,"And as the parent of two young children, I’m particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that we’re seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use. Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to home in on the specific problems we’re trying to solve and use 21st century solutions for 21st century problems. Using a 20th century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you. Senator Warren, is Mr. Yang wrong? Your response, please.",Oct
Senator Warren,"Look, I’m not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It’s time to fight back. Think about it this way. When you talk about how it works in competition, about 8%, 9% of all retail sales happen in bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About 49% of all sales online happen in one place. That’s Amazon. It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses. Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game or you get to have a team, but you don’t get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating big tech, big pharma, big oil, all of them.",Oct
Marc Lacey,"Thank you, Senator Warren. Mr. Steyer, your response.",Oct
Tom Steyer,"Look, I agree with Senator Warren that in fact monopolies have to be dealt with. They either have to be broken up or regulated, and that’s part of it, but we have to understand that Mr. Trump is going to be running on the economy. He’s going to be saying he’s the person who can make it grow. I started a business from scratch, one room, no employers, and built a multi-billion dollar international business. We’re going to have to show the American people that we don’t just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies, but also talk about prosperity, talk about investing in the American people, talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector.",Oct
Tom Steyer,"In fact, if we want to beat Mr. Trump, I think somebody who can go toe to toe with them and show them to be a fraud and a failure as a business person, and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy, is going to be necessary. He is one. His tax plan’s a failure. His trade war is a failure. I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show-",Oct
Tom Steyer,… I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show that in fact he’s failed the American people and he has to go.,Oct
Marc Lacey,Thank you Mr. Steyer.,Oct
Marc Lacey,Senator Booker how do you respond? Would a President Booker break up big tech companies like Facebook and Amazon?,Oct
Senator Booker,"Anybody that does not think that we hae a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy. We have seen it in the ’16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform. Antitrust, I mean Robert Bork right now is laughing in his sleep. We have a reality in this country where antitrust, from pharma to farms, is causing trouble. We have to deal with this. As president of the United States I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws.",Oct
Senator Booker,"I want to say one last thing, and I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage, going back to the fact that we … It’s rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.",Oct
Marc Lacey,Thank you Senator.,Oct
Marc Lacey,Congressman O’Rourke you say you’re not sure if it’s appropriate for a president to designate which companies should be broken up. What’s the proper level of oversight here?,Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"Yeah. We need to set very tough, very clear transparent rules of the road. The kind of rules that we do not have today. That allow these social media platforms, where we the people have become the product, to abuse that public trust. To do so at extraordinary profits. Right now we treat them functionally as a utility. When in reality they’re more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see. Our pictures and personal information that they share with others. We would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing. To publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the Vice President. Treat them like the publisher that they are. That’s what I will do as president.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,We will be unafraid to breakup big businesses if we have to do that. But I don’t think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That’s something that Donald Trump has done. In part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It’s not something that we should do.,Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"Tough rules of the road, protect your personal information, privacy and data. Be fearless in the face of these tech giants.",Oct
Marc Lacey,Senator Sanders your response?,Oct
Bernie Sanders,"When we talk about a rigged economy it’s not just the grotesque level of income in wealth and equality. It is also the fact that in sector after sector, whether it is Wall Street where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States; whether it is media where you have 10 media companies that control about 90% of what the American people see, hear or read; whether it is agribusiness where we see merger after merger, which is resulting in the decline of family based farming in this country, we need a president who has the guts to appoint an Attorney General who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business, and protect consumers by ending the price fixing which we see every day.",Oct
Marc Lacey,Thank you Senator.,Oct
Kamala Harris,Marc. Marc.,Oct
Marc Lacey,Thank you Senator.,Oct
Marc Lacey,Senator Harris to you. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that splitting up big tech companies will make election interference more likely because the companies won’t be able to work together to fight it. Could breaking up these companies make the spread of disinformation worse?,Oct
Kamala Harris,"No I don’t agree with that at all. As serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee, working with Amy Klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure, knowing that Russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the president of the United States and will attempt to do it again, that’s a ridiculous argument he’s making.",Oct
Kamala Harris,But I do want to also say this. What we’re talking about is a grave injustice. When rules apply to some but not equally to all. In particular when the rules that apply to the powerless don’t apply to the powerful.,Oct
Kamala Harris,"Senator Warren I just want to say that I was surprised to here that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies. When I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump’s account that you did not agree. I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice. He and his account should be taken down.",Oct
Kamala Harris,"We saw in El Paso that that shooter, in his manifesto, was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform. This is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shutdown that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability.",Oct
Marc Lacey,Thank you.,Oct
Marc Lacey,Senator Warren you can respond.,Oct
Senator Warren,Look I don’t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of The White House. That’s our job. But the way-,Oct
Kamala Harris,Then join me if you don’t-,Oct
Senator Warren,But the way … But let’s figure-,Oct
Kamala Harris,Join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down.,Oct
Senator Warren,No. Let’s figure out-,Oct
Kamala Harris,No?,Oct
Senator Warren,… why it is that we have had laws on the book-,Oct
Kamala Harris,Wow.,Oct
Senator Warren,"… for antitrust for over a century. Yet for decades now we’ve all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington, Big Ag, how the gun industry, big tech. We really need to address the elephant in the room and that is how campaigns are financed.",Oct
Kamala Harris,You can’t say you’re for corporate-,Oct
Senator Warren,I announced this morning-,Oct
Kamala Harris,… responsibility if it doesn’t apply to everyone.,Oct
Senator Warren,"I announced this morning that I’m not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives. We’ve already agreed Bernie and I, we’re not taking any money from big pharma executives. You can’t go behind closed doors, and take the money of these executives, and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. We need campaign finance rules and practices-",Oct
Marc Lacey,Thank you Senator Warren.,Oct
Senator Warren,… that support us all.,Oct
Kamala Harris,"It does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people. This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable.",Oct
Senator Warren,Yes.,Oct
Kamala Harris,"Holding big tech accountable because they have an out-sized influence on people’s perceptions about issues. They actually influence behaviors. We all have to agree this is their power, it is immense.",Oct
Marc Lacey,Senator Klobuchar let me bring you in-,Oct
Kamala Harris,I’m not finished.  I’m not finished. What I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.,Oct
Senator Warren,Look I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don’t have a problem with that.,Oct
Kamala Harris,So you will join me in saying-,Oct
Senator Warren,What I do have a problem with-,Oct
Kamala Harris,… Twitter should shutdown that account?,Oct
Senator Warren,"… is that if we’re going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives. I we’re going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives. If we are going to talk about Wall Street, and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives.",Oct
Marc Lacey,Thank you.,Oct
Senator Warren,So long as that’s-,Oct
Marc Lacey,Senator Klobuchar  let’s bring you in here.,Oct
Amy Klobuchar,"I would like to have a different take on this. I was in the private sector for 14 years. Represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom market. I had a life before government. What I saw was when we got more competition there the prices went down in a big way, in the long-distance market.",Oct
Amy Klobuchar,"Well right now we have another gilded age going on. I am the lead Democrat on the Antitrust Committee. I have the lead legislation, which means, one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we’ve been talking about here, is breaking down some of this consolidation. Also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because they’re so overwhelmed. But the issue here is this, start talking about this as a pro competition issue. This used to be a Republican and Democratic issue because America, our founding fathers, actually wanted to have less consolidation. We were a place of entrepreneurship. We are seeing a startup slump in this country-",Oct
Marc Lacey,Thank you Senator.,Oct
Amy Klobuchar,… and this means-,Oct
Marc Lacey,Secretary Castro would you like to-,Oct
Amy Klobuchar,… everything from tech on down.,Oct
Marc Lacey,… weigh in please respond.,Oct
Julian Castro,"Yeah. I think that we’re on the right track, in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices. Setting, as Congressman O’Rourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today. Whether that’s Amazon that is leveraging its size, I think, to help put small businesses out of business. Then at the same time shortchanging a lot of its workers. Not paying them as they should, not giving them the benefits that they should. Or it’s a number of other companies, big tech companies. We need to take a stronger stance when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices. That’s what I would do as president.",Oct
Marc Lacey,Thank you Mr. Secretary.,Oct
Andrew Yang,"That’s the way we can fight back.  The best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property. Right now our data is worth more than oil. How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail? It got lost. It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google. If we say this is our property and we share in the gains that’s the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies.",Oct
Erin Burnett,Thank you Mr. Yang.,Oct
Kamala Harris,There’s a bigger issue here.,Oct
Erin Burnett,"Turning to women’s reproductive rights. Ohio is now one of several states that has banned abortions after as early as six weeks of pregnancy. Many women don’t even know they are pregnant at that time. The Ohio law, like many others, is being challenged in the courts and has not yet taken effect. Senator Harris if states prevail on restricting abortion what’s your plan to stop them?",Oct
Kamala Harris,"My plan is as follows, for any state that passes a law that violates the Constitution, and in particular Roe v. Wade, our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v. Wade and the Constitution. If it is not that law will not go into affect. That’s called pre-clearance.",Oct
Kamala Harris,"Because the reality is that while we still have, as I said earlier, these state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, then there needs to be accountability and consequence.",Oct
Kamala Harris,"But I’ll go further. You may have seen I questioned Brett Kavanaugh when I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Asked him, as a nominee to serve on the United States Supreme Court, could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body? The answer was, “Uh, uh, no.” The reality of it is this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America. Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species. Our bodies were created to do that. It does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body. It is her body, it is her right, it is her decision.",Oct
Erin Burnett,Senator Harris thank you.,Oct
Erin Burnett,"Senator Klobuchar, what would you do to stop states from prevailing? Your response?",Oct
Amy Klobuchar,"I would codify Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. But what I want to do right now is just say what if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me? You know what I would say to him? I’d say, “You know you said you wanted to do this. In your race for president you actually said that you wanted to put women in jail. Then you tried to dial it back and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail. That is exactly what the Alabama law is. It put doctors in jail for 99 years. You Donald Trump are not on the side of women. You are not on the side of people of this country when over 75% of people want to keep Roe v. Wade on the book. When over 90% of people want to make sure we have available contraception. You defunded Planned Parenthood. I would fund it again.”",Oct
Erin Burnett,Senator thank you.,Oct
Erin Burnett,"Senator Booker, if states prevail on restricting abortion how would you stop them? Please respond.",Oct
Senator Booker,"Well first of all let’s be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio, they’re not just a tax on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country liberty, the ability to control your own body, but they are particular another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty. Because this is disproportionately affecting low income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country. It is an assault on the most fundamental ideal, that human beings should control their own body.",Oct
Senator Booker,"The way, as president of the United States, I’m going to deal with this is first of all elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House level position. I will create the Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights in The White House. Make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt, that’s gone on for decades, to undermine Roe v. Wade. I will fight to codify it. I will also make sure that we fight, as this country, to repeal the Hyde Amendment so that we are leading the planet Earth in defending the global-",Oct
Erin Burnett,Thank you Senator.,Oct
Senator Booker,… assault we see on women right now.,Oct
Erin Burnett,Congresswoman Gabbard your response?,Oct
Tulsi Gabbard,"This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make. It’s unfortunate to see how, in this country, it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon. I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare I think she’s correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you’re referring to can often lead to a dangerous place. As we’ve seen them, as they’re passed in other countries, where a woman who has a miscarriage passed that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point.",Oct
Tulsi Gabbard,I do however think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that during the third trimester abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.,Oct
Erin Burnett,Thank you very much.,Oct
Erin Burnett,"The Supreme Court is currently made up of five Republican appointed justices and four appointed by Democrats. The Court just announced it will hear arguments in a case challenging some abortion rights. Vice President Biden the Constitution does not specify the number of justices that serve on the Supreme Court. If Roe v. Wade is overturned on your watch, and you can’t pass legislation in Congress, would you seek to add justices to the Supreme Court to protect women’s reproductive rights?",Oct
Joe Biden,"I would not get in a Court . We had three justices, next time around we lose control they had three justices. We began to lose any credibility the Court has at all.",Oct
Joe Biden,"I want to point out that the justices I’ve supported … When I defeated Robert Bork and I say when I defeated Robert Bork I made sure we guaranteed a woman’s right to chose for a better part of a generation. I would make sure that we move and insist that we codify Roe v. Wade. The public is already there. Things have changed. I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio, Alabama, et cetera, who in fact are throwing up this barrier. Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. In fact every woman should have that right. I would not pack the Court. What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the Court, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan, who used to work for me, to others, that they in fact support the right of privacy. On which the entire notion of a woman’s right to choose is based. That’s what I would do. No one would get on the Court …",Oct
Joe Biden,"By the way, if in fact at the end of this … The beginning of next year, if in fact one of the justices steps down, God forbid, in fact I would make sure that we would do exactly what McConnell did last time out. We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice.",Oct
Erin Burnett,Thank you Mr. Vice President.,Oct
Erin Burnett,Mayor Buttigieg you have discussed expanding the Court from nine to 15 justices. What’s your response to the Vice President?,Oct
Pete Buttigieg,"That’s right. When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate. Now I’m not talking about packing the Court just with people who agree with me, although I certainly will appoint people who share my values. For example the idea that women’s reproductive freedom is an American right. What I’m talking about is reforms that will depoliticize the Court. We can’t go on like this, where every single time there is a vacancy we have this apocalyptic ideological firefight over what to do next.",Oct
Pete Buttigieg,"Now one way to fix this would be to have a 15 member Court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10. Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal on how this could be done without a constitutional amendment. But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis. There are other reforms that we could consider. From term limits, don’t forget justices used to just retire like everybody else, to a rotation off the appellate bench.",Oct
Erin Burnett,Thank you.,Oct
Pete Buttigieg,I’m not wedded to a particular solution but I am committed to establishing a commission on day one-,Oct
Erin Burnett,Thank you Mayor Buttigieg.,Oct
Pete Buttigieg,… that will propose reforms to depoliticize the Supreme Court because we can’t go on like this.,Oct
Erin Burnett,Thank you very much Mayor Buttigieg.,Oct
Erin Burnett,Secretary Castro he’s talking about making the Court bigger. Your response? Is it a good idea?,Oct
Julian Castro,"I don’t think it is. I wouldn’t pack the Court. I think the plan that Mayor Pete mentioned is an interesting one, but I actually believe if we were selecting from one of those things that the smarter move might be to look at term limits or having people cycle off from the appellate courts. So that you would have a replenishment of perspective.",Oct
Julian Castro,"I would also make sure that I appoint, as president, people who respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade. That we codify Roe v. Wade. That we do away with things like the Hyde Amendment because you shouldn’t only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money. We have to think about people who do not, people who are poor. We have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom but also reproductive justice. Invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her healthcare needs met.",Oct
Erin Burnett,Senator Warren would you consider adding more justices to the Supreme Court to protect Roe v. Wade? Your response?,Oct
Senator Warren,"I think there are a number of options. I think as Mayor Buttigieg said there are many different ways. People are talking about different options. I think we may have to talk about them. But on Roe versus Wade can we just pause for a minute here. I lived in an America where abortion was illegal. Rich women still got abortions because they could travel, they could go to places where it was legal. What we’re talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young, are 14 year olds who were molested by a family member. We now have support across this country. Three out of four Americans believe in the rule of Roe versus Wade. When you’ve got three out of four Americans supporting it we should be able to get that passed through Congress.",Oct

Anderson Cooper,"As some of you have indicated the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. Vice President Biden just on either side of you Senator Warren is calling for big structural change, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?",Oct
Joe Biden,"Well I think there vision is attracting a lot of people. I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But as Senator Warren said, “We can’t be running any vague campaigns.” We got to level with people. We’ve got to level with people and tell them exactly what we’re going to do, how we’re going to get it done. If you can get it done.",Oct
Joe Biden,"I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here but I’m the only one on this stage that’s gotten anything really big done. From the Violence Against Women Act, to making sure that we passed the Affordable Care Act, to be in a position where we in fact took almost a 90 billion dollar act that kept us from going into a depression, putting us in a position where I was able to end Roe … Excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales, in terms of assault weapons. The question is who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is who’s going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done?",Oct
Joe Biden,"I’m not suggesting they can’t but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. Part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how you’re going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Just to clarify Vice President, who are you saying is being vague?",Oct
Joe Biden,"Well the senator said … She’s being vague on the issue of … Actually both of them are being vague on the issue of the Medicare for all.

Anderson Cooper,Senator Sanders respond.,Oct
Bernie Sanders,"… in two ways. Joe you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill which is hurting middle class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done which have cost us four million jobs.",Oct
Bernie Sanders,"Now let’s get to Medicare for all. Let’s be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. The answer is if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies, and the insurance companies, and tell them that the function of healthcare is the guaranteed care to all people. Not to make 100 billion dollars in profit.",Oct

Anderson Cooper,Senator Warren your response?,Oct
Senator Warren,"You started this question with how you got something done. Following the financial crash of 2008 I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. All of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, “Don’t even try because you will never get it passed.” Sure enough the big banks fought us, the Republicans fought us, some of the Democrats fought us, but we got that agency passed into law.

I don’t agree that there’s any such thing as back to normal because here in the industrial Midwest, definitely where I live, normal didn’t work. That’s part of how we got here. That’s part of how a guy like Donald Trump managed to get within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place.",Oct

Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things we’ve attempted in my lifetime. Medicare for all who want it, actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the ’80s, an assault weapons ban which would be a huge deal, making college free for low and middle income students. Yet there are some here on this stage who say it doesn’t count unless we go even further. Free college for low and middle income students isn’t good enough unless we’re also paying for the children of billionaires.

I don’t know how sensational or exciting that was to everyone in the country, or even most people in El Paso, but it was important to those veterans who I served. We set about turning around the VA. Hiring up the psychiatrists, and psychologists, and therapists to take care of those women and men who’d put their lives on the line for this country.",Oct

Anderson Cooper,"We’re back for the CNN/ New York Times Democratic Presidential Debate. We have time for one more question that we would like all of you to weigh in on. Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former president George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship saying, “We’re all different, and I think that we’ve forgotten that. That’s okay, that we’re all different.” So in that spirit, we’d like you to tell us about a friendship that you’ve had that would surprise us, what impacts it’s had on you and your beliefs. Secretary Castro begin with you.",Oct
Julian Castro,"Well, first of all, thank you to Mark, thank you Anderson, and thank you Aaron and CNN and New York Times and everybody who’s here tonight. Some of the most interesting friendships that I’ve had have been with people different from me. Either people older than me that had a lot to teach me or people who grew up very different from me. Also, teachers as I was growing up, people that had a life experience that when I was growing up was beyond mine. And sometimes also, and this goes to the heart of your question, I think people who thought differently from me. Folks that I considered and have considered friends, and I think that there’s a value to that. I think that that should be reflected more in our public life. I also believe to just speak about the incident last week with Ellen and George W. Bush, I completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others.",Oct
Julian Castro,"I believe that we should be more kind to other folks. I also believe that we should hold people to account for what they’ve done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something, and I think that we can do both of those things. I think that we can kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions and their people, whether it’s our former president, George W. Bush or others that should be held accountable just as we should be kind. We shouldn’t be made to feel shameful about holding people accountable for what they’ve done.",Oct

It actually means something much more powerful than that. It means I come to you with respect and a recognition that we are all connected. We are all brothers and sisters, we are all God’s children. So I’ve developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially with Republicans like Trey Gowdy, for example. He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues. We’ve developed a friendship that’s based on respect and he’s been there for me during some personally challenging times. The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided. Donald Trump must be defeated. But we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump. We need to deliver a win for the American people.",Oct
Tulsi Gabbard,"We must stand United as Americans remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president. Inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all. When I look out at our country, I don’t see deplorables, I see fellow Americans. People who I treat with respect even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly. I will work to restore a White House that represents light and compassion and respect for every American regardless of race, religion, orientation, gender or political affiliation.

I traveled all over the world with him and he would sometimes when we were seated with world leaders and they would look away from me, he’d say, “Senator Klobuchar is a lead Democrat on this trip and she will go next.” And I still remember being there at his ranch. John and I went to visit him and Cindy when he was dying and he pointed to some words in his book because he could hardly talk. And the word said this, there is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself. That’s what we’re doing right now. And while we have had major debates about policy, we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. And we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy, but to change the tone in our politics, to look up from our phones, to look at each other, to start talking to each other because the way we win and not just win the presidency, but take back the US Senate is by winning big.",Oct

She’s a different gender, she’s a different race, she’s from a different part of the country. But she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism. And her honor, my mother was a school teacher in the New York public schools and in the Brooklyn House of Detention. My father was the first generation in his family to go to college. My grandfather was a plumber. He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg. And when I asked him what that experience meant, he said, “When you see something wrong in your society, you fight it from the first day and every single day after.” And that’s why I started the need to impeach movement two years ago, because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.",Oct
Tom Steyer,"And over 10 years ago, I saw that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every American in terms of the climate crisis, and I’ve been fighting those companies with the help of the American people ever since successfully and that’s why I’m running for president because our government has failed. It’s been taught by corporations and it’s absolutely essential to return power to the people. I have been doing exactly what my parents taught me to do, which is to take on the biggest problems in America directly and fight for them every single day.",Oct

I did that as a small business owner more than 20 years ago, making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in El Paso, Texas. Did it as a member of the city council where I saw my colleagues, not as Republicans or Democrats, but my fellow EL Pasoans who had a responsibility to deliver for our community. As a member of Congress, I remember being in San Antonio, I was visiting the VA there March of 2017. I found that my flight had been snowed in Washington, D.C. Happened to be in the elevator with a Republican member of Congress, Will Hurd and on a whim I said, “Do you want to just rent a car and drive from San Antonio to Washington?” And he called my bluff. We got in that Chevy Impala last car on the lot, it was spring break, drove 1600 miles across the country. Live streamed the conversation, a Republican and a Democrat, finding out what we had in common.",Oct
Beto O’Rourke,"By the end of that trip, not only had we formed a friendship, but we had formed trust. We worked with each other on each other’s bills. I got Will to work with me on an immigration bill, showing party leaders from either side that Republicans and Democrats can work together on an otherwise contentious issue. And then across Texas, I mentioned winning more votes than in any Democrat. We want independence and Republicans in record numbers as well.

Senator Booker,"Well, look, I have so many, I don’t even know where to count. I was the mayor of a large city with a Republican governor, he and I had to form a friendship even though I can write a dissertation on our disagreements. When I got to the United States Senate, I went there with a purpose of making friendships across the aisle. I go to Bible study and chairman in Hoff’s office. He and I passed legislation together to help homeless and foster kids. I went out to try to invite every one of my Republican colleagues to dinner and let me again say, finding a dinner in a restaurant, agreeing on one with Ted Cruz was a very difficult thing. I’m a vegan and he’s a meat eating Texan, but I’ll tell you this right now, this is the moment in America that this is our test, the spirit of our country, I believe in the values of rugged individualism and self-reliance, but think about our history.",Oct
Senator Booker,"Rugged individualism didn’t get us to the moon. It didn’t beat the Nazis. It didn’t map the human genome. It didn’t beat Jim Crow. Everything we did in this country, big and vice president, we have done so many big things. The fact that there’s an openly gay man now, black woman, all of us on the stage or because we in the past are all inheritors of a legacy of common struggle and common purpose. This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office, it’s a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other. The next leader is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all, not throw elbows at other Democrats that are unfair because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic grace in our country. Teach us a more courageous empathy and remind America that patriotism is love of country and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow country men and women and love is not sentimentality, it’s not anemic. Love is struggle.",Oct

Love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the declaration of independence that if we’re ever going to make it as a nation, we must mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.

My surprising friendship, it’s been so much fun running for president because I’ve gotten to meet so many Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise. The friendship that sticks out for me guy named Fred, who’s an avid Trump supporter, a trucker. He let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail. I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs. And I’m happy to say that after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me. And we’ve remained in touch ever since.",Oct
Andrew Yang,"The truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party. The fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail, call centers, transportation, as well as to white collar workers like attorneys, pharmacists, and radiologists. It does not care about our party. Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016 and what did he say? He said, we’re going to build a wall. We’re going to turn the clock back. We’re going to bring the old jobs back. America, we have to do the opposite of all of these things. We have to turn the clock forward. We have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible. We have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value. It is not left, it is not right, it is forward and that is where we must take the country in 2020.",Oct

Kamala Harris,"Thank you. Probably Paul Ryan. Actually, I invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bail system in the United States. He and I agree on almost nothing, but we agreed on that. And after we joined forces, he said to me, “Kamila, you know, Appalachia loves this. And it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And I guess that’s why I’m running. I do believe that to beat Donald Trump, but also to heal our country. We need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And I’ll tell you, my mother was 19 when she left India alone and she wanted to travel to learn science because her mission in life was to cure cancer.",Oct
Kamala Harris,"And so she arrived in California, she was supposed to have an arranged marriage, but she got involved in the civil rights movement. She met my father and that produced my sister and me. They got married. But when I was five, that marriage ended. But my mother convinced us that we could do anything. And so I became the first woman attorney, general California. The second black woman elected to the United States Senate. And I will tell you, that’s part of why I’m running, because Donald Trump, if he had his way, my story would not be possible. And I am running to make sure that that dream, the American dream, American values, American ideals will always hold true. And so that’s what is at stake in this election and I believe I am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak the story of the American dream and the need to reclaim it.",Oct

Pete Buttigieg,"Well, I think about the friendships that I formed in the military. People who were radically different from me, different generation, different race, definitely different politics and we learned to trust each other with our lives. When they got into my vehicle, and when we went outside the wire, they didn’t care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend. They didn’t care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not. We just learned to trust each other. In fact, the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go to war to get there is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important. I guess I’ll follow in the pattern tonight and point out you could go to peteforamerica.com and read all about it.",Oct
Pete Buttigieg,"It’s also about building a sense of belonging in this country because I think that’s what friendship and that’s what service can create and I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self-medicating and we’re seeing a rise in the deaths from despair. I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country. The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president. It is the unification of the American people and I’m asking for your vote to be that president when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency, pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future.",Oct

Bernie Sanders,"When I was chairman of the Senate Committee on veterans affairs, I tried to get through the most comprehensive piece of veterans legislation in modern American history and I failed. I only had two Republicans to vote with me in the Senate, so we had to go back to the drawing board. And I worked with John McCain and I certainly did not get in that legislation working with McCain all that I wanted, but it turned out that we were able to pass a very, very significant piece of legislation, including $5 billion more for the veterans administration. More recently, I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah, mike Lee. And Mike understood, although he and I disagree on everything, that the US involvement in the Saudi led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen. And for the first time in 45 years, we were able to get the War Powers Act utilized and get the votes to get the US troops out of that area.",Oct
Bernie Sanders,"But I think at the end of the day what I appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that Trump is fostering on our people, the divisiveness, trying to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation or our religion, and there is no job that I would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man, woman, and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1%. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country.",Oct

For me, it would be Charles Fried. 27 years ago when I was under consideration for a job, he was someone who had been George Bush, the first solicitor general, a deeply principled Republican. And we didn’t agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was, but he also was willing to listen to my work about what’s happening to America’s middle class. And Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure I got the job. I grew up out in Oklahoma, I have three older brothers. They all served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers and there are a lot of things that we’re divided on there are core things that we believe in together. We want to see all of our children get a good start in life.",Oct

They know that we have an America that’s working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind. People across this country, regardless of party, are ready to say no more. We want an America that works for everyone. 2020 is our moment in history. It is a deep honor to be here, to be in this fight. I know what’s broken, I know how to fix it and we are building a grassroots movement to get it done. That includes everyone.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Thank you, Senator Warren. Vice president Biden.",Oct
Joe Biden,"This is reassuring in the fact that we’re all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country. The two people maybe that surprised you the most were, he’s been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy and he was assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends, became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children and on his deathbed, he asked me to do his eulogy. I would say to John, “John, you didn’t see a war. You never wanted a fight.” And he’d say, “You didn’t see a problem. You’d never wanted to solve.” But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable, he was honorable.",Oct
Joe Biden,"And one of the things, that’s the reason why I’m running, we have to restore the soul of this country. That’s why I’m doing this. In fact, this president has ripped the soul out of this country, divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous, a liar. He cheats. He does not do anything to promote people generally. Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle class and the only we’re going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle. My dad used to say, “A job’s about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It’s about your dignity.” We have to restore people’s dignity. And lastly, we have to unite the country because folks, it’s time we stop walking around with our heads down. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century.",Oct
Joe Biden,"So for God’s sake, get up, get up, and remember, this is the United States of America. There’s nothing, nothing we’re unable to do when we decide we’re going to do it. Nothing at all, period.",Oct
Anderson Cooper,"Candidates, thank you. That concludes the fourth Democratic Presidential Debate. We want to thank Otterbein University for hosting us. Now, please stay tuned for CNN for special coverage of tonight’s debate with Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo.",Oct
Jake Tapper,"Hello everyone. I’m Jake Tapper at the Democratic Debate here in Westerville, Ohio tonight…",Oct
Rachel Maddow,"We’re in the middle of the fourth presidential impeachment proceedings in our nation’s history. Ambassador Gordon Sondland delivered testimony today in the House impeachment inquiry that buttressed the case that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with President Zelensky because he wanted the Ukrainian president to announce investigations that would benefit President Trump politically. Senator Warren, you have said already that you’ve seen enough to convict the president, and remove him from office. You and four of your colleagues on this stage tonight who are also US Senators may soon have to take that vote. Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?",Nov
Senator Warren,"Of course I will. And the obvious answer is to say, first read the Mueller Report, all 442 pages of it, that showed how the president tried to obstruct justice, and when Congress failed to act at that moment, and that the president felt free to break the law again and again and again. And that’s what’s happened with Ukraine. We have to establish the principle, no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it. But I want to add one more part based on today’s testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? This is not a man who had any qualifications except one. He wrote a check a million dollars, and that tells us about what’s happening in Washington.",Nov
Senator Warren,"The corruption, how money buys its way into Washington. You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they’re going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I’ve taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don’t ask to be an ambassador, because I’m not going to have that happen. I asked everyone who’s running for president to join me in that, and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say, we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Warren, thank you, Senator Klobuchar, You’ve said that you support the impeachment inquiry, but you want to wait for a Senate trial to hear the evidence and make a decision about convicting the president. After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct, and I’ve called for an impeachment proceeding. I just believe our job as jurors is to look at each count, and make a decision. But let me make very clear that what this impeachment proceeding about is really our democracy at stake. This is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests in front of our country’s interest. And this is wrong. This is a pattern with this man, and it goes to everything from how he has betrayed our farmers, and our workers, to what he has done with foreign affairs, leaving the Kurds for slaughter, sucking up to Vladimir Putin every minute of the day.",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"That is what this guy does. And I think it is very, very important that we have a president that’s going to put our country first. I was thinking about this when I was at the Carter Presidential Museum, and on the wall are etched the words of Walter Mondale when he looked back at their four years, not perfect, and he said this, “We told the truth. We obey the law. We kept the peace.” We told the truth, we obeyed the law. We kept the peace. That is the minimum that we should expect in a President of the United States.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Senator, thank you, Senator Sanders, I’d like to go to you. Americans are watching these impeachment hearings. At the same time, they’re also focused on their more immediate, daily, economic, and family concerns. How central should the president’s conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any democratic nominees campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"Well, Rachel, sadly, we have a president who is not only a pathological liar, he is likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America. But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? We’re going to lose the election. Right now, you’ve got 87 million people who have no health insurance, or under-insured. We are facing the great existential crisis about time in terms of climate change. You got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street, and you got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing. What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. In other words, we can deal with Trump’s corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country. We also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt, dominated by a handful of billionaires, and that our economy is rigged with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America. We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Mayor Budttigieg, let me put the same question to you. How  campaign, how central would it be to yours?",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, the constitutional process of impeachment should be beyond politics, and it is not a part of the campaign, but the president’s conduct is. The impeachable conduct that we have seen, in the abuse of power that we’re learning more about in the investigations. But just to be clear, the president’s already confessed to it on television, but that’s just part of what we’ve seen. Under normal circumstances, a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all, which was the president had to confess, in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans. We are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrongdoing, but we are also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the Trump Presidency comes to an end, one way or the other.",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"I’m running to be the president for that day the sun comes up, and the Trump Presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country. And we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever, and while doing it, address big issues that didn’t take a vacation for the impeachment process, or for the Trump Presidency as a whole, a climate approaching the point of no return. The fact that we’ve still got to act on healthcare, kids learning active shooter drills before they learn to read, and an economy where even when the Dow Jones is looking good, far too many Americans have to fight like hell just to hold onto what they’ve got.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,Mr. Mayor.,Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"Those are the crises that will be awaiting the next president, and will be at the heart of our campaign.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,Mr Mayor. Thank you. Andrea.,Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Vice President Biden, you’ve suggested in your campaign that if you defeat President Trump, Republicans will start working with Democrats again. But right now Republicans in Congress, including some of whom you’ve worked with for decades, are demanding investigations, not only of you but also of your son. How would you get those same Republicans to work with you?",Nov
Joe Biden,"Well, look, the next President of the United States is going to have to do two things. Defeat Donald Trump, that’s number one. And number two, going to have to be able to go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places, and get a Senate majority. That’s what I’ll do. You have to ask yourself up here, who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place. And secondly, who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the house, and in the Senate? And by the way, I learned something about these impeachment trials. I learned number one, that Donald Trump doesn’t want me to be the nominee. That’s pretty clear.",Nov
Joe Biden,"He held up aid to make sure that while at the same time innocent people in  are getting killed by Russian soldiers. Secondly, I found out that Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be president. So I’ve learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that are being held. But the bottom line is, I think we have to ask ourselves the honest question, who is most likely to do what needs to be done? Produce a democratic majority in the United States Senate, maintain the House, and beat Trump?",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Senator Harris, your thoughts about that?",Nov
Kamala Harris,"Well first of all, we have a criminal living in the White House, and there is no question that in 2020, the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment is justice is on the ballot. And what we saw today is Ambassador Sondland, by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop. That means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the President, from what we heard today, the Vice President, the Secretary of State and the Chief of Staff. And so this not only points to the corrupt nature of this administration and the need for these impeachment proceedings to go forward, but it also points to another issue.",Nov
Kamala Harris,"And back to the question that you asked earlier, which is what does this mean for the American people? Because what it means when I watch this, is that there are clearly two different set of rules for two different groups of people in America. The powerful people, who with their arrogance think they can get away with this, and then everybody else. Because here’s the thing. For those working people who are working two and three jobs, if they don’t pay that credit card by the end of the month, they get a penalty. For the people who don’t pay their rent, they get evicted. For the people who shoplift, they go to jail. We need the same set of rules for everybody, and part of the reason I’m running for president is to say that we have to bring justice back to America for all people. And not just for some.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Warren, you have cast yourself as a fighter. If you were elected though, you would be walking into an existing fight, a country that is already very divided over the Trump Presidency, among other things. Do you see that divide as permanent, or do you need to bring the country together if you become president to achieve your goals?",Nov
Senator Warren,"So I think the way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is we talk about the things that unite us. And that is, that we want to build an America that works for the people, not one that just works for rich folks. You know, I have proposed a two cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than 50 billion dollars in assets. Your first 50 billion is free and clear. But your 50 billionth and first dollar, got to pitch in 2 cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, you’ve got to pitch in a few pennies more. Here’s the thing, doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone. It’s about saying you built something great in this country, good for you. But you did it using workers. All of us help pay to educate. You did it using, you’re getting your goods to on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You did it protected by police and firefighters, all of us help pay the salaries for.",Nov
Senator Warren,"So when you make it big, when you make it really big, when you make it top one 10th of 1% big, pitch in 2 cents, so everybody else gets a chance to make it. And here’s the thing, that’s something that Democrats care about, independents care about, and Republicans care about. Because regardless of party affiliation, people understand across this country, our government is working better and better for the billionaires, for the rich, for the well-connected, and worse and worse for everyone else. We come together when we acknowledge that and  real change.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Thank you Senator. Thank you. Senator Booker, do you agree with that strategy?",Nov
Senator Booker,"Well, first of all, I think we all agree that we need to bring in a lot more revenue in this country. We actually have a real problem with the tax rates, tax loopholes, tax cheats, and I don’t agree with the wealth tax the way that Elizabeth Warren puts it, but I agree that we need to raise the estate tax. We need to tax capital gains as ordinary income. Real strategies will increase revenue. But here’s the challenge. We as Democrats need to fight for a just taxation system. But as I travel around the country, we Democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth as well.",Nov
Senator Booker,"When I stood in church recently, and asked folks in a black church, how many people here want to be entrepreneurs? Half the church raised their hands. If we as a country don’t start, if we as a party, don’t start talking, not just about how to tax wealth, but to give more people opportunities to create wealth, to grow businesses, to have their American dream. Because yeah, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, $15 an hour. But the people in communities I frequent, they’re not aspiration for their lives is not just to have those fair wages. They want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth, but they want to have equalities of opportunity. And that’s what our party has to be about as well.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Senator Warren, you wanted to respond?",Nov
Senator Warren,"Sure. So let me just tell you what we can do with that two cent wealth tax. Two cents on the top one 10th of 1% in this country, and we can provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five. That is transformative. We can provide universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in America. We can stop exploiting the women, largely black and brown women who do this work, and we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America. We can put 800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition free for every kid. We can put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities, and we can cancel student loan debt for 95% of the folks who’ve got it. Two cent wealth tax and we can invest in an entire generation’s future.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,All right. Let me let Senator Booker respond.,Nov
Senator Warren,Sure.,Nov
Senator Booker,"You know, again, I agree with the need to do all of those things. We’re all united in wanting to see universal preschool, and I’ll fight for that. We’re all united in wanting to fund HBCUs. Heck, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for two parents that went to HBCUs. But the tax, the way we’re putting the forward right now, the wealth tax, I’m sorry, it’s cumbersome. It’s been tried by other nations. It’s hard to evaluate. We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation. But again, we as Democrats have got to start talking, not just about how we tax from a stage, but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it.",Nov
Senator Booker,"Look at VC dollars in this country. 75% of them go to the three metropolitan areas. There is worth in the inner city. There is value in our rural areas. If I am President of the United States, we’re going to have a fair just taxation where millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share, but dear God, we’re going to have pathways to prosperity for more Americans. We’re going to see a change in what we see right now. Small businesses, new startups are going down in this country.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Thank you, Senator, Senator Warren.",Nov
Senator Booker,We need to give more new entrepreneurs access to wealth.,Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Senator Warren, briefly, just your last thoughts on this.",Nov
Senator Warren,"So, just the idea behind what is fair, today the 99% in America are on track to pay about 7.2% of their total wealth in taxes.",Nov
Senator Booker,I’m not disagreeing with that.,Nov
Senator Warren,"The top one 10th of 1% that I want to say pay two cents more, they’ll pay 3.2% in America. I’m tired of freeloading billionaires. I think it’s time that we ask those at the very top to pay more, so that every single one of our children gets-",Nov
Senator Booker,"But everybody is tired of freeloading billionaires. Everybody’s tired of corporations paying zero taxes, I’m not disagreeing with that.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Thank you very much. Senator Warren. Thank you. Mayor Buttigieg, you have said quote, I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point. The Republican party never stopped fighting President Obama in his eight years in office. So what would you do that President Obama didn’t do to change that?",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, as President Obama commented recently, we are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago. And to me, the extraordinary potential of the moment we’re in right now is that there is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues, that didn’t exist in the same way even a few years ago. Even on issues where Democrats have been on defense, like immigration, and guns, we have a majority to do the right thing. If we can galvanize, not polarize that majority. For example, on healthcare.",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"The reason I insist on Medicare for all who want it as the strategy to deliver on that goal we share of universal healthcare, is that that is something that as a governing strategy, we can unify the American people around. Creating a version of Medicare, making it available to anybody who wants it, but without the divisive step of ordering people onto it whether they want to or not. And I believe that commanding people to accept that option, whether we wait three years as Senator Warren has proposed or whether you do it right out of the gate, is not the right approach to unify the American people around a very, very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,Thank you Mr. Mayor. Kristen Welker.,Nov
Kristen Welker,"Let’s talk about Medicare for all. Senator Warren, you are running on Medicare for all, Democrats have been winning elections even in red states with a very different message on health care, protecting Obamacare. Democrats are divided on this issue. What do you say to voters who are worried that your position on Medicare for all could cost you critical votes in the general elections?",Nov
Senator Warren,"I look out and I see tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their medical bills, 37 million people who decided not to have a prescription filled because they just can’t afford it. People didn’t take the test the doctor recommended because they just can’t afford it. So here is my plan. Let’s bring as many people in and get as much help to the American people as we can, as fast as we can. On day one, as president, I will do, bring down the cost of prescription drugs on things like insulin and EpiPens. That’s going to save tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars for people.",Nov
Senator Warren,"I’m going to defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump Administration. And in the first hundred days, I’m going to bring in 135 million people into Medicare for all at no cost to them. Everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four, income less than $50,000. I’m going to lower the age of Medicare to 50 and expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental and longterm care. And then in the third year when people have had a chance to feel it, and taste it and live with it, we’re going to vote, and we’re going to want Medicare for all.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"Senator, thank you, Senator. Senator Sanders, let me bring you into this conversation-",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"Thank you, I wrote the damn bill.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"And ask you the question, I want to ask you the question this way, Senator Sanders, you describe your campaign including your plans for Medicare for all as a political revolution, President Obama explicitly said the country is quote less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. The average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it, end quote. Is President Obama wrong?",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"No, he’s right. We don’t have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want. And the American people understand today that the current healthcare system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional. Now you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country, and yet we got 87 million uninsured, underinsured, in some cases we pay 10 times more for prescription drugs as do the people of Canada, or other countries. 500, 000 people go bankrupt because of medically-related issues, they come down with cancer, and that’s a reason to go bankrupt?",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"Now, some of the people up here think that we should not take on the insurance industry. We should not take on the pharmaceutical industry. But you know what? If you think back to FDR, and if you think to JFK, and Harry Truman, and Barack Obama, as a matter of fact, people have been talking about healthcare for all. Well, you know what? I think now is the time. And in the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for all, Medicare for all, that means no deductibles, no copayments, no out-of-pocket expenses. That’s where we got to go.",Nov
Kristen Welker,Thank you Senator Sanders. Vice President Biden.,Nov
Joe Biden,"You know, we can do this without charging people raising 30, 40 trillion dollars. The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for all. It couldn’t pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn’t pass the House. Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who thinks it makes sense. We should build on Obamacare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan, and not make people choose. Allow people to choose I should say. If you go the route of my two friends on my right and my left, you have to give up your private insurance. 160 million people like their private insurance, and if they don’t like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal. In my plan, drug prices go down, premiums go down across the board. But here’s the deal. They get to choose. I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies, they want no competition, and my friends say you have to only go Medicare for all.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"Vice President Biden, thank you. Ashley.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Congresswoman Gabbard, you have criticized Hillary Clinton as the quote personification of the rut that has sickened the democratic party. What is the rut you see in the democratic party?",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,"That our democratic party unfortunately is not the party that is of, by, and for the people. It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others foreign policy, by the military industrial complex, and other greedy corporate interests. I’m running for president to be the democratic nominee that rebuilds our democratic party, takes it out of their hands and truly puts it in the hands of the people of this country. A party that actually hears the voices of Americans who are struggling all across this country, and puts it in the hands of veterans and fellow Americans who were calling for an end to this ongoing Bush, Clinton, Trump, foreign policy, doctrine of regime change wars, overthrowing dictators in other countries, needlessly sending my brothers and sisters in uniform into harm’s way to fight in wars that actually undermine our national security, and have cost us thousands of American lives.",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,"These are Wars that have cost us as American taxpayers, trillions of dollars since 9/11 alone, dollars that have come out of our pockets, out of our hospitals, out of our schools, out of our infrastructure needs. As president, I will end this foreign policy, end these regime change wars, work to end this new cold war and arms race, and instead invest our hard earned taxpayer dollars actually into serving needs of the American people right here at home.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you congresswoman. Senator Harris, any response?",Nov
Kamala Harris,"Oh, sure. I think that it’s unfortunate that we have someone on the stage who is attempting to be the democratic nominee for President of the United States, who during the Obama administration spent four years, full-time on Fox news criticizing President Obama.",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,That’s ridiculous Senator Harris.,Nov
Kamala Harris,"Who had spent full-time criticizing people on this stage, as affiliated with the democratic party, when Donald Trump was elected, not even sworn in, buddied up to Steve Bannon to get a meeting with Donald Trump in the Trump Tower, fails to call a war criminal by what he is as a war criminal, and then spends full time during the course of this campaign, again, criticizing the democratic party. What we need on the stage on the November is someone who has the ability to win, and by that we need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump, and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition, and bring the party and the nation together, I believe I am that candidate.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you Senator. Congresswoman Gabbard, I’ll give you a chance to respond.",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,"What Senator Harris is doing is unfortunately continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I’m making the leadership and the change that I’m seeking to bring in our foreign policy, which only makes me guess that she will, as president, continue the status quo. Continue the Bush/Clinton/ Trump foreign policy of regime change wars, which is deeply destructive. This is personal to me, because I served in Iraq. I left my seat in the state legislature in Hawaii, volunteered to deploy to Iraq where I served in a medical unit where every single day I saw the terribly high human cost of war. I take very seriously the responsibility that the president has to serve as Commander in Chief, to lead our armed forces, and to make sure always, no, I’m not going to put party interests first. I will put the interests of the American people above all else.",Nov
Ashley Parker,Thank you Congresswoman. I want to briefly give Senator Harris a final second to respond.,Nov
Kamala Harris,"I believe that what our nation needs right now is a nominee who can speak to all people. I spent my entire career standing mostly in a courtroom, speaking five words, Kamala Harris for the people. And it was about all the people, regardless of their race, regardless of their gender, regardless of where they live geographically, regardless of the party with which they’re registered to vote, or the language their grandmother speaks. We need someone on this debate stage in November who has the ability to unify the country, and to win the election, and I believe again, I am that candidate.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you, Senator.",Nov
Kamala Harris,Thank you.,Nov
Ashley Parker,"Mr. Steyer, You have denounced the special interests that pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process to influence it, but in fact you have spent over $300 million of your own money in support of your political goals. How do you respond to critics who see you is the embodiment of a special interest?",Nov
Tom Steyer,"What I’ve done over the last decade is to put together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to take on unchecked corporate power. We have a broken government in Washington DC. It’s been purchased by corporations. Over the last decade, with the help of the American people, we have taken on and beaten the oil companies, we have taken on and beaten the tobacco companies, we’ve taken on and beaten utilities, we’ve taken on and beaten the drug companies. I’ve also built one of the largest grassroots organizations in the United States. Last year, NextGen America did the largest youth voter mobilization in American history.",Nov
Tom Steyer,"I also, in partnership with seven national unions, knocked on 15 million doors in 2016, and 10 million in 2018. What I’ve done is to try to push power down to the American people, to take power away from the corporations who’ve bought our government. And I’m talking now about structural reform in Washington DC. Term limits. If you want bold change in the United States, you’re going to have to have new and different people in charge. I’m the only person on this stage who will talk about term limits. Vice President Biden won’t. Senator Sanders won’t, even Mayor Pete Buttigieg will not talk about term limits and structural change. I would let the American people pass laws themselves through direct democracy. It’s time to push the power back to the people-",Nov
Ashley Parker,Thank you Mr. Steyer.,Nov
Tom Steyer,And away from DC.,Nov
Ashley Parker,"Mr. Steyer, thank you. Senator Klobuchar, a brief response.",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"Well, I’m someone that doesn’t come from money and I appreciate the work of Mr. Steyer, but right now we have a system that’s not fair. And it’s not just fair for money, and so what I would do is start a constitutional amendment, and pass it to overturn Citizens United. That’s what we should do so that we stop this dark money and outside money from coming into our politics. I have led the way on voting, and I can tell you right now, one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18. If we had a system like this, and we did something about gerrymandering, and we stopped the voting purges, and we did something significant about making sure we don’t have money in politics from the outside, Stacey Abrams would be governor of this state right now.",Nov
Ashley Parker,Thank you Senator.,Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"And that’s what should have happened. So while I appreciate his work, I am someone that doesn’t come from money. I see my husband out there, my first Senate race, I literally called everyone I knew and I set what is still an all-time Senate record. I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends. And I’d like to point out, it is not an expanding base. So I don’t just think this with my head, I feel it in my heart.",Nov
Ashley Parker,Thank you Senator Klobuchar. Mr. Yang-,Nov
Tom Steyer,"Since I was named, I’d like to chime in here.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Mr. Yang, you’ve made a virtue of your outsider status. You’ve never served in the military, or in government. What has prepared you to respond to a terrorist attack or a major disaster?",Nov
Andrew Yang,"Well first, I just want to stick up for Tom. We have a broken campaign finance system, but Tom has been spending his own money fighting climate change, and you can’t knock someone for having money and spending it in the right way, my opinion.",Nov
Tom Steyer,Thanks Andrew.,Nov
Andrew Yang,"Yeah, no problem. As Commander in Chief, I think we need to be focused on the real threats of the 21st century. And what are those threats? Climate change, artificial intelligence, loose nuclear material, military drones, and non-state actors. And if you look up, we’re in the process of potentially losing the AI arms race to China right now. Because they have more access to more data than we do, and their government is putting billions of dollars to work subsidizing the development of AI in a way that we are not. We are 24 years behind on technology, and I can say that with authority, because we got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995. Think about that timing. I guess they thought they’d invented everything. The next Commander in Chief has to be focused on the true threats of tomorrow, and that’s what I’ll bring to the table as commander in chief.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. Andrea?",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Mayor Buttigieg, let’s talk about your record as a candidate. You were elected mayor in a democratic city, receiving just under 11,000 votes. And in your only statewide race, you lost by 25 points. Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump. I get that it’s not traditional establishment Washington experience, but I would argue we need something very different right now. In order to defeat this president, we need somebody who can go toe to toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he’s been appealing to. I don’t talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them. I don’t even golf. As a matter of fact, I never thought I’d be on a Forbes Magazine list, but they did one of all the candidates by wealth, and I am literally the least wealthy person on this stage. I also wore the uniform of this country, and know what is at stake in the decisions that are made in the Oval Office, in The Situation Room. And I know how to bring people together to get things done.",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small, but frankly where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small. The usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small, and I believe we to send somebody in who has a different kind of experience, the experience on the ground, solving problems, working side by side with neighbors on some of the toughest issues that come up in government. Recognizing what is required of executive leadership, and bringing that to Washington so that Washington can start looking a little more like our best run communities in the Heartland, before the other way around starts to happen.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,Thank you Mayor.,Nov
Pete Buttigieg,…Communities in the Heartland before the other.,Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"“Of the women on the stage. Do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience he had? No, I don’t. Maybe we’re held to a different standard.” Senator, what did you mean by that?",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"First of all, I’ve made very clear, I think that Pete is qualified to be up on this stage and I am honored to be standing next to him. But what I said was true. Women are held to a higher standard, otherwise we could play a game called name your favorite woman president, which we can’t do because it has all been men and including all vice presidents being men and I think any working woman out there, any woman that’s at home knows exactly what I mean.",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"We have to work harder and that’s a fact, but I want to dispel one thing because for so long, why has this been happening? I don’t think you have to be the tallest person on this stage to be president. I don’t think you have to be the skinniest person. I don’t think you have the loudest voice on the stage. I don’t think that means that you will be the one that should be precedent. I think what matters is if you’re smart, if you’re competent and if you get things done.",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"I am the one that has passed over a hundred bills as the lead Democrat in that gridlock of Washington in Congress on this stage. I think you’ve got to win and I am the one Mr. Vice president that has been able to win every red and purple congressional district as the lead on a ticket every time. I governed both with my head and my heart and if you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Mr. Vice president, just a quick response.",Nov
Joe Biden,"I think a woman’s qualified to be president and there’s no reason why. If you think the woman is the most qualified person now you should vote for them. The reason why I think I should be president and be the nominee is number one, I have brought people together my entire career. In the United States Senate, I’ve passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined. From the violence against women act, to making sure we have the chemical weapons treaty to did to dealing with Milosevic.",Nov
Joe Biden,"The whole range of things that I’ve been engaged in my whole career. I’ve done it. I’ve brought people together. I’m always told by everybody on here, things have changed. You can’t do that anymore. If we can’t. I thought the question was initially ask of the Senator, how do you unify this country? We have to unify this country. I have done it. I have done it repeatedly and lastly to be commander in chief, there’s no time for on the job training. I’ve spent more time in the situation room, more time abroad, more time than anybody up here. I know every major world leader, they know me and they know when I speak. If I’m the president United States who were four who were against and what we’ll do and we’ll keep our word.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Thank you. Thank you, vice president. Ashley.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Senator Booker, one of the defining characteristics of the Trump is that the American people hear from him directly all the time about everything on Twitter and just about everywhere else. Setting aside your views of his tone, is that unfiltered communication, something you as president would continue? Is this one of the norms broken by president Trump that needed to change?",Nov
Senator Booker,"So look, this president has broken norms as you’ve said. He used this platform to demean, degrade and divide this country in ways that are repugnant and appalling. But the next president, whoever they are, is going to have to be someone who can heal and bring this nation together, this whole nation. So absolutely in that office, I will do whatever it takes to make sure we bring this country together. But it’s not for a kumbaya moment. We are a nation that achieves great things when we stand together and work together and fight together.",Nov
Senator Booker,"So absolutely. When I was mayor of the largest city in my state, and this is where I agree with mayor Pete. Mayoral experience is very important. And I happened to be the other road scholar mayor on this stage. And what I learned there is that you have to be an executive that can heal. In my city, we have racial divides. We have geographic divides that go from wealth to people that are struggling. The success of my city was because we brought us all together and did things that other people said couldn’t be done. When I am president United States, my campaign from the very beginning has not changed. My charge is to see a nation right now, which has so much common pain to channel that back into a sense of common purpose and I will do whatever it takes. Bringing creativity to that office like has never been seen before.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you, senator. Rachel.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Chants of lock her up are still heard at president Trump’s rallies today. Now, some opponents of the president are turning the same slogan against him. They’ve chanted, lock him up at a recent World Series game in Washington and at a Veterans Day event in New York and Senator Sanders at at least two of your campaign events recently. Senator, should Democrats discourage this or are you okay with it?",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"Well, I think the people of this country are catching on to the degree that this president thinks he is above the law. And what the American people are saying, “Nobody is above the law” and I think what the American people are also saying is in fact, that if this president did break the law, he should be prosecuted like any other individual who breaks the law. But at the end of the day, what we need to do is to bring our people together, not just in opposition to Trump. The initial question I think that you wrote, that somebody raised him was that we are a divided nation. You know what? I kind of reject that. I think when you talk about the pain of working families in this country, majority of the American people want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. When you talk about the climate crisis, the overwhelming majority of the American people know that it is real. They know we have to take on the fossil fuel industry.",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"They know we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Even on issues like guns, the American people are coming together to end the horrific level of gun violence. So I believe, yep, we’ve got to deal with Trump, but we also have to have an agenda that brings our people together so that the wealth and income doesn’t just go to the people on top, but to all us.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Vice president Biden, let me ask you to pick up on the issue that Senator Sanders just raised about no one being above the law. When president Ford pardoned president Nixon, he said it was to heal the country. Would you support a potential criminal investigation into president Trump after he leaves office? Even if you thought it might further inflame the country’s divisions?",Nov
Joe Biden,"Look, I would not direct my justice department like this president does. I’d let them make their independent judgment. I would not dictate who should be prosecuted or who should be exonerated. That’s not the role of the president of the United States. It’s the attorney general of the United States, not the president’s attorney private attorney. And so I would whatever was determined by the attorney general, I supported, that I appointed, let them make an independent judgment. If that was the judgment that he violated the law and he should be in fact criminally prosecuted then so be it.",Nov
Joe Biden,"But I would not direct it and I don’t think it’s a good idea that we model ourselves after Trump and say, “lock him up.” Look, we have to bring this country together. Let’s start talking civilly to people and tweeting. The next president starts tweeting should… Anyway, it just, we look, it’s about civility. We have to restore the soul of this country and that’s not who we are. That’s not who we’ve been. That’s not who we should be.",Nov
Joe Biden,"Follow the law. Let the justice department make the judgment as to whether or not someone should be prosecuted, period.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Sanders, let me ask you briefly to respond to that. The difference of opinion there with vice president Biden.",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"Well, I think Joe is right. I think that is the function of the attorney general, but what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe, and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television, they do believe that we have a president who thinks he’s above the law. We have a president who is engaged in corruption. We have a president who was obstructed justice, and in my view, somebody was a violated the emoluments clause. I think Joe is right. That is the function of an independent department of justice, but my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law.",Nov
Joe Biden,Can I respond very quickly?,Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Briefly, senator.",Nov
Joe Biden,"Distinction, should he be impeached and should it be thrown out of office? That’s one question. He’s very close to impeaching… He’s indicted himself. Number two, after he’s thrown out of office or after he’s defeated, should he be then prosecuted? Should he be prosecuted for a criminal offense while he was president? That’s a judgment to be made by an attorney general.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Mr. vice president, thank you. Ashley.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"We now focus on an issue facing and many Americans, childcare and paid family leave. Here in Georgia, the average price of infant daycare can be as much as $8,500 per child per year. That’s more than in state tuition at a four year public college in Georgia. Mr. Yang, what would you do as president to ease that financial burden?",Nov
Andrew Yang,"There are only two countries in the world that don’t have paid family leave for new moms, the United States of America and Papua New Guinea, that is the entire list and we need to get off this list as soon as possible. I would pass paid family leave is one of the first things we do. I have two kids myself who are four and seven, one of whom is autistic and has special needs and it’s breaking families backs.",Nov
Andrew Yang,"We need to start supporting our kids and families from the beginning because by the time they’re showing up to Pre-K and kindergarten, in many cases, they’re already years behind. Studies have shown that two thirds of our kids’ educational outcomes are determined by what’s happening to them at home. This is stress levels, number of words, read to them as children type of neighborhood, whether a parent has time to spend with them.",Nov
Andrew Yang,"So we need to have a freedom dividend in place from day one, $1,000 a month for every American adult, which would put in many cases, $2,000 a month into families pockets so that they can either pay for childcare or if they want stay home with the child. We should not be pushing everyone to leave the home and go to the workforce. Many parents see that trade off and say if they leave the home and work, they’re going to be spending all the money on childcare anyway. In many cases, it’d be better if the parents stays home with the child.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. Sticking with this topic, no parent in the United States is federally guaranteed a single day of paid leave when they have a new baby. A number of you on stage tonight have plans to address this.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Senator Harris, you’re one of the candidates proposing legislation to guarantee up to six months of paid family leave and Senator Klobuchar, you’re one of the candidates proposing up to three months. I want to hear from both of you on this, starting with you Senator Klobuchar, why three months?",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"I looked at this economically and I want to make sure of that. We help people because it’s just pointed out we are way behind the curve, our country is when it to providing paid family leave and childcare. We must do this and we will do this if we have the right person heading up the ticket so we can win big. But what I had done with all of my plans is I have showed how I’m going to pay for them meticulously.",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"I think that is really, really important when we have a president in the white house right now who have told over 10,000 lies. So when you look at my website at amyklobuchar.com you will see my plans and you’re also going to see how I’m going to pay for it. And I think that is so important because this president is literally increasing the debt, treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in a bankrupt casino and really putting this country in a worse financial situation every single day. So yes, my plan is three months. I think that’s good. I’d love to do more.",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"As I’ve said before, I’d love to staple free diplomas under people’s chairs. I just am not going to go for things, and this is not, I’m not talking about Senator Harris’s plan here. But I’m talking about some of the other ideas that have been out here. I am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car.",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"I think that we have an obligation, we have an obligation as a party to be yes, fiscally responsible. Yes, think big, but make sure we have people’s backs and are honest with them about what we can pay for and that is everything from sending rich kids to college for free, which I don’t support to kicking 149 million off their health insurance for health insurance in four years. I just think we have to be smart about how we do this.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you, Senator and Senator Harris, why six months and also how would you pay for that?",Nov
Kamala Harris,"Sure. Everybody please visit my website, kamalaharris.org for the details on everything I talk about. Six months, so part of how I believe we’re going to win this election is it is going to be because we are focused on the future. We are focused on the challenges that are presented today and not trying to bring back yesterday to solve tomorrow.",Nov
Kamala Harris,"So on paid family leave, it is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their 20s. People are having children in their 30s often in their 40s, which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents. Which requires a lot of work from traveling back and forth to a hospital to daycare, to all of the activities that are required, much less the healthcare needs that are required.",Nov
Kamala Harris,"And what we are seeing in America today is the burden principally falls on women to do that work. And many women are having to make a very difficult choice whether they’re going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family, or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on. So six months paid family leave is meant to and is designed to adjust to the reality of women’s lives today.",Nov
Kamala Harris,"The reality also is that women are not paid equal for equal work in America. We pass the Equal Pay Act in 1963 but fast forward to the year of our Lord 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar. Black women, 61 cents, Native American women, 58 cents Latinos, 53 cents.",Nov
Kamala Harris,"So, but so my policy is about, there’s a whole collection of work that I’m doing that is focused on women and working women in America and the inequities and therefore the injustice that women in America are facing that needs to be resolved and addressed.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you, senator. Kristen.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"Mr. Steyer, millions of working Americans are finding that housing has become unaffordable, especially in metropolitan areas. It is particularly acute in your home state of California and places like Los Angeles and San Francisco. Why are you the best person to fix this problem?",Nov
Tom Steyer,"When you look at inequality in the United States of America, you have to start with housing. Where you put your head at night determines so many things about your life. It determines where your kids go to school. It determines the air you breathe, where you shop, how long it takes you to get to work. What we’ve seen in California is as a result of policy, we have millions too few housing units and that affects everybody in California.",Nov
Tom Steyer,"It starts with a homeless crisis that goes all through the state, but it also includes skyrocketing rents that affect every single working person in the state of California. I understand exactly what needs to be done here, which is we need to change policy and we need to apply resources here to make sure that we build literally millions of new units.",Nov
Tom Steyer,"But the other thing that’s going to be true about building these units is we’re going to have to build them in a way that’s sustainable. That in fact, how we build units where people live has a dramatic impact on climate and on sustainability.",Nov
Tom Steyer,"So we are going to have to direct dollars, we’re going to have to change policy and make sure that the localities and municipalities who’ve worked very hard to make sure that there are no new housing units built in their towns, that they have to change that and we’re going to have to force it and then we’re going to have to direct federal dollars to make sure that those units are affordable so that working people can live in places and not be spending 50% of their income on rent.",Nov
Kristen Welker,Thank you. Mr Cyrus. Senator Warren. I see your hand raised.,Nov
Senator Warren,"Yes. Think of it this way. Our housing problem in America is a problem on the supply side and that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time, affordable housing. Also private developers, they’ve gone up to the mansions. They’re not building the little two bedroom, one bath house that I grew up in, garage converted to be a bedroom for my three brothers. So I’ve got a plan.",Nov
Senator Warren,"For 3.2 million new housing units in America, those are housing units for working families for the working poor, for the poor poor for seniors who want to age in place for people with disabilities. For people who are coming back from being incarcerated. It’s about tenants rights, but there’s one more piece.",Nov
Senator Warren,"Housing is how we build wealth in America. The federal government has subsidized the purchase of housing for decades for white people and has said for black people, “You’re cut out of the deal.” That was known as red lining when I built a housing plan. It’s not only a housing plan about building new units, it’s a housing plan about addressing what is wrong about government sponsored discrimination, how we need to address it and we need to say we’re going to reverse it.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"Thank You, Senator, Senator Booker.",Nov
Senator Booker,"I’m so grateful again as a mayor, who was a mayor during the recession, who was a mayor during a housing crisis who started my career as a tenants’ rights lawyer. This are all good points, but we’re not talking about something that is going on all over America, which is gentrification and low income families being moved further and further out, often compounding racial segregation. And so all of these things, we need to put more federal dollars in it, but we’ve got to start empowering people.",Nov
Senator Booker,"We use our tax code to move wealth up the mortgage interest deduction. My plan is very simple. If you’re a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent, then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount you’re paying in the area meeting your rent. That empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners and what that does is it actually slashes poverty. 10 million people out, and by the way, for those people who are facing eviction, it is about time that the only people when they show up in rentals court that have a lawyer is not the landlord. It is also low income families struggling to stay in their home.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"Thank you, Senator. Rachel.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"We’re going to take a quick break, but we will be right back with these candidates from the MSNBC Washington Post Democratic Candidates Debate in Atlanta, Georgia. Stay with us.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,Welcome back to the MSNBC Washington Post Democratic Candidates Debate. Let’s get right back into it. American farmers are struggling under the effects of president Trump’s trade war with China.,Nov
Rachel Maddow,"The Trump administration’s payments to farmers to offset those losses, already have a price tag that is more than double what was spent on the Obama administration’s auto bailout. Mayor Buttigieg, would you continue those farm subsidies?",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"We shouldn’t have to pay farmers to take the edge off of a trade war that shouldn’t have been started in the first place. I will support farmers, but not long ago I was in Boone, Iowa, a guy came up to me, he said, “I got my Trump bailout check, but I would have rather spent that money on conservation.” By the way, this isn’t even making farmers whole. If you’re in soybeans, for example, you’re getting killed and it’s not just what this president’s done with the trade war and a lot of parts of the country.",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"The worst thing is these so-called small refinery waivers, which are killing those who were involved in ethanol. Look, I don’t think this president cares one bit about farmers. He keeps asking them to take one for the team, but more and more I’m talking to people in rural America who see that they’re not going to benefit from business as usual under this president.",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"I believe that so many of the solutions lie with American farmers, but we have to stand up for them not just with direct subsidies and support, but with making sure we do something about the consolidation, the monopolies that leave farmers with fewer places to purchase supplies from and fewer places to sell their product to, and American farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change.",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,I believe that the quest for the carbon negative farm could be as big as symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car in this country. And it’s an important part of how we make sure that we get a message out around dealing with climate change that recruits everybody to be part of the solution including conservative communities where a lot of people have been made to feel that admitting climate science would mean acknowledging their part of the problem.,Nov
Rachel Maddow,I’m sorry to interrupt but I need you to answer the question. Would you continue those subsidies or not?,Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"Yes, but we won’t need them cause we’re going to fix the trade war.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Thank you sir. The UN recently reported that what was once called climate change is now a climate crisis, with drastic results already being felt. Climate is also an issue important to our audience. We received thousands of questions from our viewers and many of them were about climate. Calista from Minneapolis writes this out. “Leading the world in resolving the climate crisis will be a multi-decade project spending far beyond even a two term presidency. If you are elected president, how would you ensure that there is secure leadership and bipartisan support to continue this project?” Congresswoman Gabbard.",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,"This is an issue that impacts all of us as Americans and people all over the world. This is not a Democrat issue or Republican issue. This is about the environmental threats that each and every one of us face. These are the kinds of conversations that we’re having in our town hall meetings and house parties in different parts of the country where we have Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, and independents coming together saying, “Hey, we are all concerned about making sure that we have clean water to drink for our families, that we have clean air to breathe, that we’re able to raise our kids in a community that’s safe.”",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,"It is the hyper partisanship in Washington unfortunately, that has created this gridlock that has stood in the way of the kinds of progress that I bring bring about as president, transitioning our country off of fossil fuels and ending the nearly $30 billion in subsidies that we as taxpayers are currently giving to the fossil fuel industry. Instead of investing in a green, renewable energy economy. That leads us into the 21st century with good paying jobs, a sustainable economy, investing in infrastructure and transitioning our agriculture.",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,"That is a great contributor to the environmental threats we face towards an agriculture system that focuses on local and regional production of food, healthy food that will actually feed the health and wellbeing of our people leading as a leader in the world to make the global change necessary to address these threats.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Thank you, congresswoman. I want to bring in Mr. Steyer on this. You’ve made climate change a central point of your political career to this issue of making change, changes that last. Making changes that are permanent. Could you address that, sir?",Nov
Tom Steyer,"Rachel, I’m the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the number one priority for me. Vice president Biden won’t say it. Senator Warren won’t say it. It’s a state of emergency and I would declare a state of emergency on day one. I would use the emergency powers of the presidency. I know that we have to do this. I’ve spent a decade fighting and beating oil companies, stopping pipelines, stopping fossil fuel plants, ensuring clean energy across the country. I know that we have to do this. I also know that we can do this. I would make this the number one priority of my foreign policy as well.",Nov
Tom Steyer,"We can do this and create literally millions of good paying union jobs across this country. I would make sure that my climate policy was led by environmental justice and members of the communities where this society has chosen to put our air and water pollution, which are low income black and brown communities and when we ask how are we going to pull this country together, how about this? We take on the biggest challenge in history. We save the world and we do it together. If you think that would pull America together, I do.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Quickly vice president Biden, you were name checked there. I’d like to give you a chance to response.",Nov
Joe Biden,"Yeah, I was. I think it is the existential threat to humanity. It’s the number one issue and I might add, I don’t really need kind of a lecture from my friend. While I was passing the first climate change bill and that Politifact said was a game changer.",Nov
Joe Biden,"While I manage the $90 billion recovery plan, investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time we’ve ever done it. My friend was producing more coal mines and produce more coal around the world according to the press than all of Great Britain produces. I welcome him back into the fold here and he’s been there for a long while. But the idea that we talk about where we started and how we are, let’s get this straight. I think it is the existential threat of our time.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Thank you, Mr. Vice president.",Nov
Tom Steyer,"Can I respond to that, Rachel?",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"You may respond, Mr Steyer.",Nov
Tom Steyer,"I came to the conclusion over 10 years ago that climate was the absolute problem of our society and was the unintended consequence of our whole country being based on fossil fuels. Everybody in this room has lived in an economy based on fossil fuels and we all have to come to the same conclusion that I came to over a decade ago. If we’re waiting for Congress to pass one of the bills, and I know everybody on this stage cares about this, but Congress has never passed an important climate bill ever.",Nov
Tom Steyer,"This is a problem, which continues to get worse. That’s why I’m saying it’s a state of emergency. That’s why I’m saying it’s priority one. If it isn’t priority one, it’s not going to get done, and this is something where we absolutely have to address it upfront. We have to make it the most important thing and we can use it to rebuild and re-imagine what the United States is. We can be the moral leaders of the world again, while we clean up our air and water, and create millions of good paying jobs.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Sanders, I’m going to ask you to jump in here.",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"Tom, you stated, you were talked about the need to make climate change a national emergency. I’ve introduced legislation to just do that. Now, I disagree with the thrust of the original question. Because your question has said, “What are we going to do in decades?” We don’t have decades. What the scientists are telling us, we don’t get our act together within the next eight or nine years. We’re talking about cities all over the world, major cities going on the water. We’re talking about increased drought, talking about increased extreme weather disturbances.",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"The United Nations is telling us that in the years to come, they’re going to be hundreds of millions of climate refugees causing national security issues all over the world. What we have got to do tonight and I will do as president, is to tell the fossil fuel industry that they’re short-term profits on not more important than the future of this planet. And by the way, the fossil fuel industry is probably criminally liable because they have lied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that they are carbon products were destroying the planet and maybe we should think about prosecuting them as well.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. Andrea.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"President Trump has dramatically changed America’s approach to our adversaries by holding summits with Kim Jong-un, getting out of the Iran nuclear deal and at times embracing Vladimir Putin and other strong men. So let’s talk about what kind of commander in chief you would be.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Senator Harris, North Korea is now threatening to cancel any future summits. If president Trump does not make concessions on nuclear weapons. If you were commander in chief, would you make concessions to Kim Jong-un in order to keep those talks going?",Nov
Kamala Harris,"With all due deference to the fact that this is a presidential debate, Donald Trump got punked. He has conducted foreign policy since day one, born out of a very fragile ego that fails to understand that one of the most important responsibilities of the commander in chief is to concern herself with the security of our nation and Homeland. And to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation and therefore an extension of our ability to be secure is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth, and we are loyal.",Nov
Kamala Harris,"What Donald Trump has done from pulling out of the Paris agreement to pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal to consistently turning a back on people who have stood with us in difficult times, including most recently, the Kurds, points out that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the national security of our nation at this moment.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,But would you make concessions to North Korea?,Nov
Kamala Harris,"Not at this point. There are no concessions to be made. He has traded a photo op for nothing. He has abandoned by shutting down the operations with South Korea for the last year and a half, so those operations which should be, and those exercises which should be active because they are in our best national security.",Nov
Kamala Harris,The relationship that we have with Japan. He has in every way compromised our ability to have any influence on slowing down or at least having a check and balance on North Korea’s nuclear program.,Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Thank you. Senator. Mr. vice president. President Trump inherited the North Korea problem from past presidents, so we’re in decades. What would a president Biden do that president Obama didn’t do in eight years?",Nov
Joe Biden,"First of all, I would go back and making sure we had the alliances we had before he became president. He has absolutely ostracized us from South Korea. He has given North Korea everything they want to create in the legitimacy. By having a meeting with Kim Jong-un who’s a thug, although he points out that I’m a rabid dog needed to be beaten with a stick. Very recently it was a comment.",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"Other than that, you like him.",Nov
Joe Biden,"Other than that, I like him. And not in Japan and Australia and being a Pacific power. And putting pressure on China in order for them to make sure that it is a non, it is a nuclear-free peninsula. And the way we do that is we make clear to China, which I have done personally with the president of China, and that is we’re going to move up our defenses. We are going to continue to make sure we increase our relationship with South Korea. And if they view that as a threat, it’s an easy thing to respond to. They in fact can in fact put pressure on.",Nov
Joe Biden,"… to respond to. They can, in fact, put pressure on North Korea. But the fact is that we’re in a position where he has done this across the world. He’s embraced thugs. Look what Putin is doing in Europe. Putin is, his whole effort is to break up NATO to increase his power, look what he’s done to it. This guy has no idea what he’s doing, he has no notion how to go about it and we need a commander in chief for what he stands. Everybody knows what he or she-",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Two more US soldiers were killed today in Afghanistan, tragically, in America’s longest war. Senator Sanders, you’ve long said you want to bring the troops back home from Afghanistan. Would you cut a deal with the Taliban to end the war even if it means the collapse of the Afghan government that America has long supported?",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"Well, let me just say this. One of the big differences between the Vice President and myself is he supported the terrible war in Iraq and I helped lead the opposition against it. And not only that, I voted against the very first Gulf War as well. And I think we need a foreign policy which understands who our enemies are, that we don’t have to spend more money on the military than the next 10 nations combined. But to answer your question, yeah. I think it is time after spending many trillions of dollars on these endless wars which have resulted in more dislocation and mass migrations and pain in that region, it is time to bring our troops home.",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"But unlike Trump, I will not do it through a tweet at three o’clock in the morning. I will do it working with the international community and if it’s necessary to negotiate with the Taliban, of course, we will do that. But at the end of the day we have to rethink the entire war on terror, which has caused so much pain and lost so many lives, not only for our own men and women in the armed forces, but for people in that region as well.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Thank you, Senator. Ashley?",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you. Mr. Yang. If you win the 2020 election, what would you say? In your first call with Russian President, Vladimir Putin?",Nov
Andrew Yang,"Well, first I’d say, “I’m sorry I beat your guy.”",Nov
Senator Warren,"It’s a sorry, you’re not sorry?",Nov
Andrew Yang,"Well, not sorry. And second, I would say the days of meddling in American elections are over and we will take any undermining of our democratic processes as an act of hostility and aggression. The American people would back me on this. We know that they’ve found an underbelly and they’ve been clawing at it and it’s made so that we can’t even trust our own democracy. The third thing I would say is that we’re going to live up to our international commitments. We’re going to recommit to our partnerships and alliances including NATO. And it was James Mattis, that said that the more you invest in diplomats and diplomacy, the less you have to spend on ammunition.",Nov
Andrew Yang,"That has to be the path forward to help build an international consensus, not just against Russia, but also to build a coalition that will help us put pressure on China in terms of their treatment of their ethnic minorities and what’s going on in Hong Kong. I want to propose a new world data organization, like a WTO for data because right now unfortunately we’re living in a world where data is the new oil and we don’t have our arms around it. These are the ways that we’ll actually get Russia to the table and make it so they have to join the international community and stop resisting appeals to the world order.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. Rachel?",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"On the issue of China, Senator Booker, China is now using force against demonstrators in Hong Kong where millions have taken to the streets advocating for democratic reforms. Many of the demonstrators are asking the United States for help. If you were president, would the US help their movement and how?",Nov
Senator Booker,"Well, first of all, this is a president who seems to want to go up against China in a trade war by pulling away from our allies and in fact, attacking them as well. We use a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. At the very time that China is breaking international rules, is practicing unfair practices, stealing technology, forcing technology transfer and violating human rights, this nation is pulling away from critical allies. We would need to show strength against China. There’s a larger battle going on on the planet earth right now between totalitarian and dictatorial countries and free democracies, and we see the scorecard under this president not looking so good, with China actually shifting more towards an authoritarian government with its leader now getting rid of term limits.",Nov
Senator Booker,"I believe we need a much stronger policy. One that’s not led as president Trump seems to want to do in a transactional way, but one that’s led by American values. Yes, we will call China out for human rights violations, but not only that, we will stop engaging in things that violate American rights. Because it is a human rights violation when people at our border, children are thrown in cages. It’s a human rights violations without coming to the United States Congress for an authorization to the use of military force for us to refuel Saudi jets to bomb Yemeni children. It is about time that this country is led by someone who will say the values of freedom and democracy or what we are going to lead with, and begin to check China, check Putin and the other folks who are trying to undermine American values and democratic values around the globe.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Thank you, Senator. Andrea?",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Mr. Vice President, the CIA has concluded that the leader of Saudi Arabia directed the murder of US-based journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. The state department also says the Saudi government is responsible for executing nonviolent offenders and for torture. President Trump has not punished senior Saudi leaders, would you?",Nov
Joe Biden,"Yes. And I said it at the time, Khashoggi was in fact murdered and dismembered and I believe in the order of the Crown Prince. And I would make it very clear we were not going to in fact sell more weapons to them, we were going to in fact make them pay the price and make them in fact the pariah that they are. There’s very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia. And I would also, as pointed out, I would end subsidies that we have, end the sale of material to the Saudis. Well, they’re going in and murdering children and they’re murdering innocent people and so they have to be held accountable.",Nov
Joe Biden,"And with regard to China, we should, look, unless we make it clear that we stand for human rights, we should be going to the United Nations seeking condemnation of China. What they’re doing with a million Uighurs that are essentially in concentration camps in the west. We should be vocally speaking out about the violation of the commitment they made to Hong Kong. We have to speak out and speak loudly about violations of human rights.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,Senator Klobuchar-,Nov
Amy Klobuchar,Yes.,Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Just to follow up, would you go against the Saudis even though that would potentially help around their adversaries?",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"We need a new foreign policy in this country and that means renewing our relationships with our allies. It means rejoining international agreement and it means reasserting our American values. When the President did not stand up the way he should have to that killing and that dismemberment of a journalist with an American newspaper, that sent a signal to all dictators across the world that that was okay, and that’s wrong.",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"And I want to add a few things to what my colleagues have said. First of all, the question about Russia. When we look at international agreements, we must start negotiating back with Russia, which has been a horrible player on the international scene. But the President precipitously got out of the nuclear agreement with Russia and we must start negotiating even though they were cheating for the good of this world. And we must also start the negotiations for the New START Treaty. And when it comes to China, we need someone that sees the long-term like I do, just like the Chinese do. Because we have a president that literally makes decisions based on his next tweet and they are in it for the long game.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,Senator Sanders?,Nov
Bernie Sanders,"I think I may have been the first person up here to make it clear that Saudi Arabia not only murdered Khashoggi, but this is a brutal dictatorship which gets every taken can to crush democracy, treats women as third class citizens. And when we rethink our American foreign policy, what we have got to know is that Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally. We have got to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room under American leadership and say, “We are sick and tired of us spending huge amounts of money and human resources because of your conflicts.”",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"And by the way, the same thing goes with Israel and the Palestinians. It is no longer good enough for us to simply to be pro-Israel. I am pro-Israel, but we must treat the Palestinian people as well with the respect and dignity that they deserve. What is going on in Gaza right now, where youth unemployment is 70 or 80% is unsustainable. We need to be rethinking who our allies are around the world, work with United nations and not continue to support brutal dictatorships.",Nov
Andrea Mitchell,"Thank you, Senator. Rachel?",Nov
Rachel Maddow,Senator Warren. Only about 1% of Americans serve in the United States military right now. Should that number be higher?,Nov
Senator Warren,"Yes, I think it should be. All three of my brothers served in the military. One was career military, the other two also served. I think it’s an important part of who we are as Americans and I think the notion of shared service is important. It’s how we help bring our nation together, it’s how people learn to work together from different regions, people who grew up differently. It’s also about how families share that sacrifice. I remember what it was like when I was a little girl, my brother, my oldest brother who served five and a half years off and on in combat in Vietnam. And what it was like for my mother every day to check the mailbox, had we heard from Don Reed, how’s he doing?",Nov
Senator Warren,"And if there was a letter, she was brighter than the day. And if it wasn’t, she’d say, “Well, maybe tomorrow.” This is about building for our entire nation and I believe we should do that. I also believe we should have other service opportunities in this country. For example, what I want to do is for our federal lands, I want to bring in 10,000 people who want to be able to serve in our federal lands to be able to help rebuild our national forests and national parks as a way to express both their public service and their commitment to fighting back against climate change-",Nov
Rachel Maddow,Senator Warren.,Nov
Senator Warren,We can do this as a nation.,Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Thank you, Senator. In president Trump’s first two years in office, the Pentagon budget ballooned. Mayor Buttigieg, would you cut military spending or would you keep it on the same upward trajectory?",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"We need to re-prioritize our budget as a whole and our military spending in particular. It’s not just how much, although we certainly need to look at the runaway in military spending, it’s also where. Right now we are spending a fraction of the intention and resources on things like the artificial intelligence research that China is doing right now. If we fall behind on artificial intelligence, the most expensive ships that the United States is building just turn into bigger targets. We do not have a 21st century security strategy coming from this president. After all, he’s relying on 17th century security technologies like a moat full of alligators or a big wall. There is no concept of strategic planning for how civilian diplomatic and military security work needs to take place for the future.",Nov
Senator Booker,Can I respond to Buttigieg?,Nov
Rachel Maddow,Thank you.,Nov
Senator Warren,Can I respond on this?,Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Coming up we will have much more from the candidates. We’re going to take a quick break, just a moment, stay with us.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"Welcome back everyone to the fifth Democratic Debate. Let’s move now to the issue of race in America. FBI Director, Christopher Wray, recently told Congress, “The majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we’ve investigated are motivated by white supremacist violence.” Congresswoman Gabbard, to you. As president, would you direct the federal government to do something about this problem that it is not currently doing?",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,"Yes, I would. We have seen for far too long the kind of racial bigotry, divisiveness and attacks that have unfortunately taken the lives of our fellow Americans. Leadership starts at the top. It’s important that we set the record straight and correct the racial injustices that exist in a very institutional way in our country. Beginning with things that have to do with our criminal justice system, where predominantly the failed war on drugs that has been continuing to be waged in this country has disproportionately impacted people of color and people in poverty. This is something that I’ll do as president and Commander-in-Chief, is to overhaul our criminal justice system working in a bipartisan way to do things like end the failed war on drugs and the money bail system.",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,"And that’s the kinds of prison reforms and sentencing reforms that we need to see that will correct the failures of the past. The most important thing here is that we recognize that we have to treat each other with respect, all of us as fellow Americans regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender orientation, and our politics. That kind of leadership starts at the top. As president, I will usher in a 21st century White House that actually represents the interests of all Americans, first and foremost.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"Congresswoman Gabbard, thank you for that. Mr. Yang, what would you do about the issue of white supremacist violence?",Nov
Andrew Yang,"Well, first we have to designate white supremacist terrorism as domestic terrorism so that the Department of Justice can properly measure it. I talked to an anti- hate activist named Christian Picciolini, who told me about how he was radicalized over a 10 year period. He said he was a lonely 14-year-old and that he was reached out to by a hate group and he wound up joining it for a decade. Now, he’s out and he’s helping convert people out of those hate groups and back into the rest of society. But what he told me was that if anyone had reached out to him when he was that hurt, broken 14-year-old boy, he would have gone with them.",Nov
Andrew Yang,"He said, “If it had been a coach I would have gone with him. If it had been a mentor teacher, I would have gone with them, but instead it was a hate group.” What we have to do is we have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular, who right now are falling through the cracks. And when you look at gun violence in this country, 96 plus percent of the shooters we’re talking about are young boys and young men. We have to as a country start finding ways to turn our boys into healthy, strong, young men who do not hate, but instead feel like they have paths forward in today’s economy.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"Mr. Yang, thank you for that. Vice President Biden. The Me Too Movement, has forced a cultural reckoning around the issue of sexual violence and harassment against women in America. Are there specific actions that you would take early in your administration to address this problem?",Nov
Joe Biden,"Yes. And by the way, it’s one of the reasons. The first thing I would do is make sure we pass the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, which I wrote. The fact, I didn’t write the reauthorization, I wrote the original act. The fact is that what happens now is that we in fact, have to fundamentally change the culture, the culture of how women are treated. That’s why as Vice President, when I asked the President if I could start the movement on the college campuses to say, “It’s on us.” It’s everyone’s responsibility.",Nov
Joe Biden,"We do not spend nearly enough time dealing with… I was stunned when I did a virtual town meeting that told me 30,000 people were on the call, young people between 15 and 25. And found out, “I said, what do you need to make you safer on college campuses and your schools?” You know what they said? “Get men involved, engage the rest of the community.” And that’s why we started this movement on the college campus is to fundamentally change the culture.",Nov
Joe Biden,"No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs. We have to just change the culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching it. It will be a big punch… no, I really mean it. It’s a gigantic issue and we have to make it clear from the top, from the President on down that we will not tolerate it. We will not tolerate this culture.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"Mr. Vice President, thank you. Senator Harris, this week you criticize Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s outreach to African American voters. You said, “The Democratic nominee has got to be someone who has the experience of connecting with all of who we are as the diversity of the American people.” What exactly prompted you to say that, Senator Harris?",Nov
Kamala Harris,"Well, I don’t know, that was a question that related to a stock photograph that his campaign published. But listen, I think that it really speaks to a larger issue and I’ll speak to the larger issue. I believe that the Mayor has made apologies for that. The larger issue is that for too long, I think candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party and have overlooked those constituencies. They show up when it’s close to election time and show up in a black church and want to get the vote, but just haven’t been there before.",Nov
Kamala Harris,"I mean, there are plenty of people who applauded black women and for the success of the 2018 election, applauded black women for the election of a Senator from Alabama. But at some point folks get tired of just saying, “Oh, thank me for showing up,” and say, “Well, show up for me.” Because when black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth in America. When the sons of black women will die because of gun violence more than any other cause of death. When black women make 61 cents on the dollar as compared to all women who tragically make 80 cents on the dollar, the question has to be where you been and what are you going to do? And do you understand who the people are?",Nov
Kamala Harris,"And I’m running for president because I believe that we have to have leadership in this country who has worked with and have the experience of working with all folks, and we’ve got to recreate the Obama coalition to win. And that means about women, that’s people of color, that’s our LGBTQ community, that’s working people, that’s our labor unions. But that is how we are going to win this election. And I intend to win.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"Senator Harris, thank you. Mayor Buttigieg, your response to that.",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"My response is I completely agree. And I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don’t yet know me. And before I share what’s in my plans, let me talk about what’s in my heart and why this is so important. As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built up over centuries, but then compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory. I care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized and cast aside and oppressed in society.",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"And I care about this because while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country. Turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate. And seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me working side by side, shoulder to shoulder. Making it possible for me to be standing here wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn’t have happened two elections ago, lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day even if they are nothing like me in their experience.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"May Buttigieg, thank you very much. Senator Harris, quick response?",Nov
Kamala Harris,"Look, there is a lot at stake in this election. And I’ve said it many times I think justice is on the ballot in 2020. And it’s about economic justice, it’s about justice for children, it’s about justice for our teachers. I could go on down the list. The issue really is not what is the fight, the issue has to be how are we going to win. And to win we have to build a coalition and rebuild the Obama coalition. I keep referring to that because that’s the last time we won.",Nov
Kamala Harris,"And the way that that election looked and what that coalition looked like was it was about having a leader who had worked in many communities, knows those communities and has the ability to bring people together and everyone is going to have to be judged on their experience and therefore ability to bring folks together around our commonalities of which I believe there are many.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Warren, quickly.",Nov
Senator Warren,"I think it is really important that we actually talk about what we’re willing to get in the fight for. And I just want to give one example around this. Senator Harris, rightly raised the question of economic justice. Let me give a specific example, and that is student loan debt. Right now African Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college, borrow more money while they’re in college and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out. Today in America, a new study came out 20 years out. Whites borrowed money, 94% of them have paid off their student loan debt. 5% of African Americans had paid it off. I believe that means everyone on the stage should be embracing student loan debt forgiveness. It will help close the black-white wealth gap. Let’s do something tangible and real to make change in this country.",Nov
Kristen Welker,"Senator Warren, thank you. Ashley?",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Senator Warren, back to you. You’ve said that the border wall that president Trump has proposed is, “A monument to hate and division.” Would you ask taxpayers to pay to take down any part of the wall on the nation’s Southern border?",Nov
Senator Warren,"If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course, we should do it. The real point here is that we need to stop this man-made crisis at the border. Trump is the one who has created this crisis and he has done it in no small part by helping destabilize the governments even further in Central America. He has withdrawn aid, that means that families have to flee for their lives, have to flee for any economic opportunity. You know what? I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families.",Nov
Senator Warren,"I went down to the border, I went down there and immediately. I was in McAllen, Texas, and I just hope everyone remembers what this looks like. There was like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men and cages of little girls and little boys. I spoke to a woman who was in the cage of nursing mothers and she told me she’d given a drink to a police officer, and that the word had come down from the gangs that she was helping the police. She knew what that meant. She wrapped up her baby and she ran for the border. We need to treat the people who come here with dignity and with respect. A great nation does not separate children from their families. We need to live our values at the border every single day.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you Senator. Senator Booker, a quick response.",Nov
Senator Booker,"Look, I want to be quick on this because I’d like to get back to something that I wasn’t included in, is…",Nov
Senator Warren,So would we all.,Nov
Senator Booker,"Absolutely, if this is not effective, we see people cutting holes in this wall, his wall, the way he brags about it, it’s just wrong. We need to have policies that respect dignity, keep us safe and strong. I wanted to return back to this issue of black voters. I have a lifetime of experience with black voters, I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African American voters. Black voters are pissed off and they’re worried. They’re pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote.",Nov
Senator Booker,"And they’re worried because the Democratic Party, we don’t want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that isn’t trusted, doesn’t have authentic connection. That’s what’s on the ballot and issues do matter. I have a lot of respect for the Vice President. He has sworn me into my office as a hero. This week I hear him literally say that I don’t think we should legalize marijuana. I thought you might’ve been high when you said it.",Nov
Senator Booker,"And let me tell you, because marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. And it’s what the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people. And let me say this, there’s more African Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850, do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children.",Nov
Senator Booker,"Because there are people in Congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana, while there are people, our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes. These are the kind of issues that mean a lot to our community and if we don’t have somebody authentically… we lost the last election. Let me just give you this data example-",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Quickly, quickly.",Nov
Senator Booker,"We lost in Wisconsin because of a massive dimunition, a lot of reasons, but there was a massive dimunition in the African American vote. We need to have someone that can inspire, as Kamala said, to inspire African Americans to the polls in record numbers.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you, Senator Booker. Vice President Biden, you can respond to that.",Nov
Joe Biden,"I’ll be very brief. Number one, I think we should decriminalize marijuana, period. And I think anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their records expunged and be completely zeroed out. But I do think it makes sense based on data that we should study what the long-term effects for the use of marijuana, that’s all it is. Number one, everybody gets out, record expunged.",Nov
Joe Biden,"Secondly, I’m part of that Obama coalition. I come out of the black community in terms of my support. If you notice I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced from me because they know me. They know who I am. Three former chairs of the Black Caucus, the only black African American woman that ever been elected to the United States Senate, a whole range of people. My point is-",Nov
Kamala Harris,That’s not true.,Nov
Senator Booker,"That’s not true, not true.",Nov
Joe Biden,"I said the first African American woman. My point is one of the reasons I was picked to be vice president was because of my relationship, longstanding relationship with the black community. I was part of that coalition.",Nov
Ashley Parker,"Thank you, Kristen?",Nov
Kristen Welker,"And we do have to take another quick break but we are going to hear much more from the candidates when we come right back here in Atlanta, Georgia. Stay with us.",Nov
Libby Casey,,Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Welcome back to the MSNBC/Washington Post Democratic candidates debate. Many states, including right here where we are tonight in Georgia, have passed laws that severely limit or outright ban abortion. Right now, Roe versus Wade protects a woman’s right to abortion nationwide, but if Roe gets overturned and abortion access disappears in some states, would you intervene as president to try to bring that access back? Senator Klobuchar.",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"Well, of course. We should codify Roe V Wade into law. That is what we should do. This President indicated early on what he was going to do and he’s done it. When he was running for office, he literally said, “Women should go to jail.” Then he dialed it back and said, “Doctors should go to jail.’ No surprise that we’re seeing these kinds of laws in Georgia, and Alabama, where his allies are passing these bills. What we have to remember is that the people are with us. I predict this will be a big election in issue in the general election. I just can’t wait to stand across from Donald Trump and say this to him, “You know what? The people are with us. Over 70% of the people support Roe V Wade, over 90% of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood and making sure that women can get the healthcare they need.” He is off the track on this and he will hear from the women of America. This is how we’re going to win this election.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Just this weekend, Louisiana reelected a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards. He has signed one of the country’s toughest laws restricting abortion. Is there room in the Democratic Party for someone like him, someone who can win in a deep red state, but who does not support abortion rights? Senator Warren.",Nov
Senator Warren,"Look, I believe that abortion rights are human rights. I believe that they are also economic rights. Protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. Understand this. When someone makes abortion illegal in America, rich women will still get abortions. It’s just going to fall hard on poor women. It’s going to fall hard on girls. Women who don’t even know that they’re pregnant because they have been molested by an uncle. I want to be an America where everybody has a chance. I know it can be a hard decision for people, but here’s the thing, when it comes down to that decision, a woman should be able to call on her mother. She should be able to call on her partner. She should be able to call on her priest or her rabbi, but the one entity that should not be in the middle of that decision is the government.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Warren, I need to push you on this a little bit for a specific answer to the question. Governor John Bel Edwards in Louisiana, is an anti-abortion governor who has signed abortion restrictions in Louisiana. Is there room for him in the Democratic Party with those politics?",Nov
Senator Warren,"I have made clear what I think the Democratic Party stands for. I’m not here to try to drive anyone out of this party. I’m not here to try to build fences, but I am here to say, “This is what I will fight for as President of the United States.” The women of America can count on me.",Nov

Bernie Sanders,"mentioned that women feel troubling on it. Well, let me just tell you that if there’s ever a time in American history where the men of this country must stand with the women, this is the moment. I get very tired, very tired of hearing the hypocrisy from conservatives who say, “Get the government off our backs. We want small government.” Well, if you want to get the government out of the backs of the American people, then understand that it is women who control their own bodies, not politicians.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Senator Sanders, thank you.",Nov
Senator Booker,This is a voting issue.,Nov
Rachel Maddow,Senator Booker.,Nov
Senator Booker,"This is a voting issue. This is a voter suppression issue. Right here in this great state of Georgia, it was the voter suppression, particularly of African American communities, that prevented us from having a Governor Stacey Abrams, right now. That is, when you have undemocratic needs, when you suppress people’s votes to get elected, those are the very people you’re going to come after when you’re in office. This bill opposed by over 70%. The Heartbeat Bill here opposed by over 70% of Georgians, is the result from voter suppression. This gets back to the issue about making sure we are fighting every single day, that whoever is the nominee, they can overcome the attempts to suppress the votes, particularly of low income and minority voters and particularly in the black community like we saw here in Georgia.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Senator, Senator Booker, thank you. To that point, individual states, as you all know, set their own rules for voting and for elections. Depending on where you live, you may be required to show ID or not. You might have a lot of days for early voting or fewer days or none. You might have a polling place in walking distance or you might have to drive or take a bus to the edge of town. With that in mind, our next question comes from Jenna in Maryland who asks, “What will you do at the executive level to ensure that every American has equal access to the ballot box?” Mayor Buttigieg.",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, we need federal leadership to establish voting rights for the 21st century because this affects every other issue that we care about. Now, the House of Representatives passed a pro democracy anti-corruption bill, which is one of many good bills to die in Mitch McConnell’s hands in the United States Senate. We know that with the White House in the right hands, we can make, for example, election days a federal holiday. We can use carrots and sticks to induce states to do the right thing with automatic voter registration, same day voter registration, making it easier for people to vote and in particular, recognizing that we cannot allow the kind of racially motivated or partisan voter suppression or gerrymandering that often dictates the outcome of election before the voting even begins.",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,Right now we have politicians picking out their voters rather than the other way around. That compounding with what is being done to restrict the right to vote means that our democracy is not worthy of the name.,Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"I just, I want to … This-",Nov

Rachel Maddow,"Forgive me, Mr. Mayor.",Nov
Amy Klobuchar,"I agree with what the mayor has just said, but this is a good example where he has said the right words, but I actually have the experience and in leading 11 of the bills that are in that house passed bill you just referred to. I think this kind of experience matters. I have been devoted to this from the time that I’ve got to the Senate. I think having that experience, knowing how you can get things done, leading the bills to take the social media companies to task a bipartisan bill to say, “Yeah, you have to say where these ads come from and how they’re paid for,” and stop the unbelievable practice where we still have 11 states that don’t have backup paper ballots. That is my bipartisan bill and I am so close to getting it done. The way I get it done is if I’m president. Just like I have won statewide, and Mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Mayor Buttigieg, I’ll let you respond to that.",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"First of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There’s more than a hundred years of Washington experience on this stage and where are we right now as a country? I have the experience of bringing people together to get something done. I have the experience of being commanded into a war zone by an American president. I have the experience of knowing what is at stake as the decisions made in those big white buildings come into our lives, our homes, our families, our workplaces and our marriages. I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Mr. Mayor, thank you.",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,I need to jump in here. Thank you.,Nov
Rachel Maddow,"on the original question of voting rights, please.",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,"I mean, voting rights are essential for our democracy. Securing our elections is essential for our democracy. I’ve introduced legislation called the Securing America’s Elections Act that mandates paper ballots to make sure that every single voter’s voice is heard, but I want to get back to Pete Buttigieg and his comment about experience. Pete, you’ll agree that the service that we both have provided to our country as veterans by itself does not qualify us to serve as commander in chief. I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels.",Nov

Tulsi Gabbard,Are you saying that you didn’t say that?,Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"I was talking about U.S., Mexico, cooperation. We’ve been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,That’s not what I said. That’s not what I said. That’s not what I said.,Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"I’m talking about building up alliances. If your question is about experience, let’s also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad. I have in my experience, such as it is, whether you think it counts or not, since it wasn’t accumulated in Washington, enough judgment that I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"Congresswoman Gabbard, let me allow you to respond.",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,"Thank you. You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels and your answer was, yes. The fact checkers can check this out, but your point about judgment is absolutely correct. Our commander in chief does need to have good judgment and what you’ve just pointed out is that you would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends to ensure the peace and national security of our nation. I take the example of those leaders who have come before us, leaders like JFK, who met with Khrushchev, like Roosevelt, who met with Stalin.",Nov
Pete Buttigieg,"Like Donald Trump, who met with Kim.",Nov
Tulsi Gabbard,"Like Reagan, who met and worked with Gorbachev. These issues of national security are incredibly important. I will meet with and do what is necessary to make sure that no more of our brothers and sisters in uniform are needlessly sent into harm’s way fighting regime change wars that undermine our national security. I’ll bring real leadership and experience to the White House.",Nov

Rachel Maddow,"Senator Sanders, I’m going to have you respond.",Nov
Bernie Sanders,"right to the point. The American people understand that the political system we have today is corrupt and it is not just voter suppression, which cost the Democratic Party a governorship here in this state, not just denying black people and people of color, the right to vote, but we also have a system through Citizens United, which allows a billionaires to buy elections. What we need to do, simple and straight forward, in every state in this country through the federal government, if you are 18 you have a right to vote, end of discussion. We have to overturn Citizens United. We need to move toward public funding of elections.",Nov
Rachel Maddow,"On this last point, Mr. Steyer.",Nov
Tom Steyer,"Well, I agree with exactly what Bernie said, but I want to talk about how we’re going to win in 2020. I don’t mean to change the subject, but I think it’s sort of important that the Democratic Party not only beat Donald Trump in 2020, but have a sweeping victory across the country. What that’s going to mean is turnout. In the United States of America, the Democratic Party keeps talking about trying to persuade a few people who are Republicans to like us, when up to half the people don’t vote at all because they think neither party tells the truth, no one deals with my issues, the system is broken, why would we vote, but what we’ve found at NextGen America, is that is the start of a conversation about why votes are so important. If you look at 2018, and flipping the house, what really happened was Democratic voting went up by three quarters in the 38 congressional districts where NextGen America was turning out young people. The turnout went up by more than a hundred percent, more than double.",Nov

Senator Booker,"Thank you, Rachel. It’s an honor to be here tonight. I have not yet qualified for the December stage. I need your help to do that. If you believe in my voice and that I should be up here, please go to CoryBooker.com, please help. I had a closing statement prepared, but I saw in the audience during the break, a man named John Lewis. Perhaps it’s interesting and important for me to mention why I’m so grateful to him. I’ve been calling in this whole election for our need to fight and fight the right way by bringing people together to create transformative change, not just beat Donald Trump. That’s the floor. We need to go to the ceiling. We need to go to the mountaintop. I am literally here on this stage right now because 50 years ago, there was a lawyer on a couch who changed his life, changed his mind to get up and start representing families, one of them, mine, who are discriminated against. The house I grew up in is because of that lawyer’s activity.",Nov
Senator Booker,"When I asked him why, why he did what he did, he told me that on March 7th, 1965, he was watching a movie called Judgment at Nuremberg on TV. They interrupted that movie to show a bridge in Alabama called the Edmund Pettus Bridge. There he saw John Lewis and other marchers who were beaten viciously by Alabama state troopers. We all owe a debt that we cannot repay. We all drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig. This is the moment in America where we need a leader that can inspire us to get up and fight again, that we have truly a moral moment in America like it was back in 1965. If you give me a chance to lead, I will cause what John Lewis says is good trouble. I will challenge us. I will ask more from you than any other president has ever asked before,-",Nov

I stand by that statement, but I’m different from everybody else on this stage. I know that the government in Washington D.C., is broken. I know that it’s been purchased by corporations and I’ve spent a decade putting together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to beat those corporations. I’m the only one on this stage who’s willing to talk about structural change in Washington itself, term limits, that if we’re going to make bold changes, we’re going to need new and different people in charge. I’m the only person on this stage who’s spent decades building an international business.",Nov
Tom Steyer,"Whoever of us is the Democratic nominee is going to have to face Mr. Trump or the Republican and talk about the economy, talk about growth, understand that we can make Mr. Trump what he is, a fraud and a failure on the economy, which is his strong point. I’m the only person on this stage who will say that climate is my first priority, that it’s our biggest challenge, but it’s our biggest opportunity to recreate this country. If you want to beat Mr. Trump, if you want to break the corporate stranglehold on this government, if you want to pass all of the progressive policies that everyone on this stage wants, I’m the person who can do it.",Nov

Inclusion, unity, respect, Aloha, these will be the operating principles for my administration. Now, Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii first back in 1959, where he expressed his appreciation for what we call the Aloha spirit. He said, “We look to you for inspiration as a bold example for what you have already succeeded in the areas of racial harmony and racial justice, where we are still struggling to achieve in other sections of the country.” He later went on to say, “As I looked out at the various faces in various colors mingled together like the waters of the sea, I see only one face, the face of the future.” Working side by side, let’s defeat the divisiveness of Donald Trump. Come together and usher in a 21st century of racial harmony, of racial justice, peace inclusion, and true equality, working side by side. Let’s make Dr. King’s dream a reality.",Nov

If you’re a parent, you’ve had this thought. Maybe you’ve been afraid to express it, and it is this, our kids are not all right. They’re not all right because we’re leaving them a future that is far darker than the lives that we have led as their parents. We are going through the greatest economic transformation in our country’s history, the fourth industrial revolution, and it is pushing more and more of our people to the side. We talk as if Donald Trump is a cause of all of our problems. He is not. He is a symptom and we need to cure the disease.",Nov
Andrew Yang,"Now, my first move was not to run for president of the United States because I am not insane. My first move was to go to D.C., talk to our leaders and say, “Technology is ripping us apart. Immigrants are being scapegoated, our kids are being left behind and the American dream that my parents came here to find is dying before our eyes.” The people in Washington D.C. had nothing for this. They don’t want to touch it. They don’t want to talk about an issue they don’t think they have a solution for. I’m not running for president because I fantasized about being president.",Nov
Andrew Yang,"I’m running for president because like many of you here in this room tonight, I’m a parent and a patriot and I have seen the future that we’re leaving for our kids.

What he said was this, he spoke to his immigrant father and he said, “In this country, you can tell the truth and it’s going to be fine.” It reminded me of a army council years and years ago in the McCarthy hearing, someone from Iowa, actually, Mr. Welch, who said, “Have you no sense of decency, sir?” I want us to remember that this election is, yes, an economic check on this President. I have bold ideas that we can do to go forward as a country to make college more affordable and bring down the costs of healthcare, yes. This is also a patriotism check, a value check, a decency check. When you look at the people that turned out in Kentucky, and turned out in Virginia, people turned out that didn’t vote in 2016. The African Americans are turning out like we didn’t see before, but we also, and they must be with us and we must get our fired up Democratic base with us.",Nov

I have taken on Jeff , I have taken on Bill Barr, I have taken on Brett Kavanaugh. I know I have the ability to do that. We also need someone who can unify the party and the country and who has the experience of having done that. I’ve done that work.

Just as local leaders have shown great leadership, we need to use the powers of the presidency on challenges like this, expanding opportunity and expanding a sense of belonging to those who have been excluded in this country. I’m not only running to defeat Donald Trump, I am running to prepare for the day that begins when Donald Trump has left office, to launch the era that must come after Trump.",Nov

I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we’re building and everybody is welcome in this future that we must create.

At the age of 21, as a member of a civil rights group at the University of Chicago, I was arrested, spent the night in jail, and I have been committed to the fight against all forms of discrimination, racial discrimination, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and religious bigotry. I will lead an administration that will look like America, will end the divisiveness brought by Trump and bring us together.

We’ve talked about climate change, we’ve talked about defense spending, we’ve talked about private health insurance. We should have talked about gun violence. What do these issues have in common? Well first, they touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. What is the second thing they have in common? We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix it and the majority of Americans are with us on it and yet we don’t make change. Why not? Because of corruption, because we have a government that works better for big drug companies than it does for people trying to fill a prescription. It works better for a giant defense industry than it does for everyone who worries about the money that goes into arms, instead of into our public schools.",Nov
Senator Warren,"We have a government that works for those at the top and not for anyone else. I have the biggest anti corruption plan since Watergate. It involves ending lobbying as we know it, blocking the revolving door between industry and Washington, making everyone who runs for federal office put their tax returns online. We have to have the courage not to make just individual changes, not to fight for little pieces.

Judy Woodruff,"Welcome back. A quick reminder of the rules for this debate – each candidate has one minute and 15 seconds to answer direct questions from the moderators, and 45 seconds to answer rebuttal and follow-up questions. Tonight’s podium order on the stage was determined by an average of recent polls. And let’s begin",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"To the candidates. Last night at this hour, the House of Representatives voted for only the third time in American history to impeach a president. Every one of you was in favor of this action. But unlike 1974 and President Nixon, congressional Democrats have so far not convinced a strong majority of Americans to support impeachment of President Trump. Why do you think that is, and what can you say or do differently in the coming weeks, to persuade more Americans that this is the right thing to do? I want to ask all of you to respond, but to begin with Vice President Biden.",Dec
Joe Biden,"You know, Judy, it was a constitutional necessity for the House to act as it did, and Trump’s response to suggest that only half of the American people want to see him thrown out of office now, I find is dumbing down the presidency beyond what I even thought he would do. Is any wonder that if you look at the international polling that’s been done that the Chinese leader is rated above American, the American president. Or that Vladimir Putin congratulated him saying, “Stand fast,” and in fact it was a mistake to impeach him. We need to restore the integrity of the presidency, of the office of the presidency. And it’s about time we get that underway. My job, and I think the job of all of us up here, is to, in fact, well that’s not true, some are going to be actually voting in the Senate. But my job is to just go out and make the case why he doesn’t deserve to be president of United States for another four years.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Senator Sanders, why do you think more people are not in support of impeachment and what else can you do?",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"Well, Judy, what I would say is that we have a president who is a pathological liar. We have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history of this country. And we have a president who is a fraud, because during his campaign he told working people one thing, and he ended up doing something else. I believe, and I will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months, is making the case that we have a president who has sold out the working families of this country, who wants to cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, after he promised he would not do that, and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president. And the case to be made is, yeah, certainly, I disagree with Trump on virtually all of his policies, but what conservatives, I think, understand, is that we cannot have a president with that temperament, who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Senator Warren, why do you think, why do you think more Americans don’t agree that this is the right thing to do and what more can you say?",Dec
E. Warren,"So I see this as a constitutional moment. Last night, the president was impeached, and everyone now in the Senate who’s taken a constitutional oath to uphold our constitution, and that doesn’t mean loyalty to an individual, it doesn’t mean loyalty to a political party, it means loyalty to our country, and that vote will play out over the next several weeks. But the way I see this is we’ve now seen the impact of corruption, and that’s what’s clearly on the stage in 2020, is how we are going to run against the most corrupt president in living history. This president has made corruption, originally, his argument, that he would drain the swamp. And yet he came to Washington, broke that promise, and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well-connected, from tax breaks to ambassadorships. We have to prosecute the case against him, and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democrat who is willing to get out and fight, not for the wealthy and well-connected, but to fight for everyone else. That’s why I’m in this race.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Senator Klobuchar… Senator Klobuchar, what argument can you make to persuade more Americans this is the right thing?",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"Let me make the case to the American people. As a wise judge said, “The president is not king in America; the law is king.” And what James Madison once said when he was speaking out at the constitutional convention, and by the way I think he’s a pretty good size for a president, he was five foot four. And what he said, he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the constitution, that the provisions are in there, is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the American people for a foreign power. That is what happened here. Watergate. This is a global Watergate. In the case of Watergate, a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent. He did it by getting people to break in. This president did it by calling a foreign leader to look for dirt on a political opponent.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"as we face his trial in the Senate, if the president claims that he is so innocent, then why doesn’t he have all the president’s men testify? Richard Nixon had his top people testify. We should be hearing from Mulvaney, who is the one under oath. Witnesses have said that Mulvaney is the one that said, “Okay, we’re going to withhold this aid to a fledgling democracy to get dirt on a political opponent.” We should hear from Bolden, who told his own staff to go see a lawyer after they met with the president. That is the case. If President Trump thinks that he should not be impeached, he should be not scared to put forward his own witnesses.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Mayor Buttigieg… Mayor Buttigieg, what additional argument can you make to the American people?",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"At the end of the day, this is beyond public opinion, this is beyond polls, this is beyond politics. The president left the House with no choice, and I think a lot of us are watching this process, watching Washington go through the motions and not expecting much, but a foregone conclusion when it gets to the Senate. We cannot give in to that sense of helplessness because that’s what they want. They want us to be taken in by that cynicism where we give up on the process altogether. Meanwhile, their allies are laughing all the way to the bank.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"As we see policies that let giant corporations, some of which made billions in profits, pay, not just zero, but as we’ve recently learned, negative taxes, all while they block policies that would actually boost wages for working Americans. Here’s the good news – it’s up to us. No matter what happens in the Senate, it is up to us in 2020. This is our chance to refuse to be taken in by the helplessness, to refuse and reject the cynicism. That is what this presidential election is about. It is what my campaign is about. Our opportunity in 2020, no matter what happens in Washington, as a country, to change the course of this nation for the better.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Mr. Yang, what more-",Dec
Tom Steyer,I’m over here.,Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Mr. Yang, what more can you say to the American people?",Dec
Tom Steyer,"Judy, Judy, sorry.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"I’m sorry, Mr. Steyer, I’m sorry.",Dec
Tom Steyer,"Well, let me remind everyone that I’m the person who started The Need to Impeach movement over two years ago. Because I believe what counts here is actually the American people’s opinion. Over eight and a half million signed that petition and dragged Washington into the idea that actually the most corrupt president in American history, it’s not a question of political expediency, it’s not a question of political tactics, it’s a question of right and wrong. So now when we look what’s going on, I actually agree with Senator Klobuchar. The question here is, if we want the American people to understand what’s going on, we need to have the administration officials testify on TV so we can judge.",Dec
Tom Steyer,"The court that counts here is the court of public opinion. The American people deserve to see the truth of these administration officials testifying under oath, so we can make up our mind. If we want Republican senators to do the right thing, we need their constituents to see the truth on TV, and tell them, “Get rid of this guy or we’ll get rid of you.” That’s what I believe in. I’m a believer in the grassroots, as an outsider, getting the American people’s voice to count. That’s who I trust and that’s who I trust now.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Mr. Yang.,Dec
Andrew Yang,"It’s clear why Americans can’t agree on impeachment. We’re getting our news from different sources, and it’s making it hard for us even to agree on basic facts. Congressional approval rating, last I checked, it was something like 17 percent, and Americans don’t trust the media networks to tell them the truth. The media networks didn’t do us any favors by missing a reason why Donald Trump became our president in the first place. If you turn on cable network news today, you would think he’s our president because of some combination of Russia, racism, Facebook, Hillary Clinton, and e-mails all mixed together.",Dec
Andrew Yang,"But Americans around the country, no different. We blasted away four million manufacturing jobs that were primarily based in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri. I just left Iowa. We blasted 40,000 manufacturing jobs there. The more we act like Donald Trump is the cause of all of our problems, the more Americans lose trust that we can actually see what’s going on in our communities and solve those problems. What we have to do is we have to stop being obsessed over impeachment, which unfortunately strikes many Americans like a ballgame where you know what the score is going to be, and start actually digging in and solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. We have to take every opportunity to present a new positive vision for the country, a new way forward to help beat him in 2020, because make no mistake, he’ll be there at the ballot box for us to defeat.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Thank you, Mr, Yang. Let’s turn now to an issue that is on the minds of all Americans, and that is the economy. Senator Sanders, today, the House of Representatives voted for a new bipartisan trade agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It was supported by union-friendly leaders like Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and big labor groups like the AFL-CIO. They say it is going to be a big job creator. Senator, my question is, will you support this deal, and if not, why not?",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"Judy, you’re talking to somebody who, unlike some of my colleagues here, voted against NAFTA, voted against PNC  with China, two agreements that cost us over four million decent-paying jobs. Now, I don’t agree with the, your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator. This is a modest improvement over what we have right now. It would allow, hopefully, Mexican workers to organize into unions or independent unions, and be able to negotiate decent contracts. But at the end of the day, in my view, it is not going to stop outsourcing. It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico, where manufacturing workers make less than two dollars an hour. What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers, stands up for farmers, and, by the way, the word “climate change,” to the best of my knowledge, is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all, which is an outrage. So no, I will not be voting for this agreement, although it makes some modest improvements.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Senator Klobuchar-,Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"I have a different view. I’ll go with my friend Sherrod Brown, who has voted against every trade agreement that’s come in front of him, and he’s voting for this, and I am too. And the reason I am voting for it is that I believe that we have a change with this agreement. I would not have voted for the agreement that President Trump put forward, but we’ve got better labor standards, better environmental standards, and a better deal when it comes to the pharmaceutical provision, which I also oppose.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"95 percent of our customers are outside of our borders, and we have to make sure that we have trade agreements that are more fair, because if we can encourage work made in America, every time you hold something in your hand that says “made in America,” it is the ingenuity of our workers. It is equality of a product, it is equality of our workers, and it is the hopes and dreams of the American people. I think this agreement, while Senator Sanders is correct, there are some issues with it, is much better than the one originally proposed. And for those farmers in the Midwest, and for those people that have been hurt by the fact that we will not have a trade segment with Mexico and with Canada and the United States, I think that this is a much better deal.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"All right. We can pull some of your, I see some other hands up. I want to move to the next question and you can bring in, I think, your points with this, but this one I’m going to initially address to Vice President Biden, and that is the overall U.S. economy right now looks strong. The unemployment rate is at historic lows, unemployment among African Americans is down, the markets are booming, wages, while not growing as much as many would like, they’re still doing about as well as they were in the Obama/Biden era. My question to you, Mr. Vice President is, what is your argument to the voter watching this debate tonight, who may not like everything President Trump does, but they really like this economy and they don’t know why they should make a change?",Dec
Joe Biden,"Well, I don’t think they really do like the economy. Go back and talk to the old neighbors in the middle class neighborhoods you grew up in. The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed and the working class has no way up as a consequence of that. You have, for example, farmers in the Midwest, 40 percent of them could pay, couldn’t pay their bills last year. You have most Americans, if they’ve received the bill for 400 dollars or more, they’d have to sell something or borrow the money.",Dec
Joe Biden,"The middle class is not, is behind the eight ball. We have to make sure that they have an even shot. We have to eliminate significant number of these god-awful tax cuts that were given to the very wealthy. We have to invest in education. We have to invest in healthcare. We have to invest in those things that make a difference in the lives of middle class people so they can maintain their standard of living. That’s not being done, and the idea that we’re growing, we’re not growing. The wealthy, very wealthy are growing. Ordinary people are not growing. They are not happy with where they are, and that’s why we must change this presidency now.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Mayor Buttigieg, is that your, is that your assessment?",Dec
Andrew Yang,"Yes. Where I live folks aren’t measuring the economy by how the Dow Jones is looking, they’re measuring the economy by how they’re doing. When you’re doing the bills at the end of the month at your kitchen table, and you find that, even if your wages have gone up, is not nearly going as fast as the cost of health, and how’s… This economy is not working for most of us, for the middle class, and, I know you’re only ever supposed to say middle class and not poor in politics, but we’ve got to talk about poverty in this country.",Dec
Andrew Yang,"There is not one county in the United States of America where someone working full time at the minimum wage can afford a two bedroom apartment. In most places, not even a one bedroom apartment. The biggest problem in our economy is simple – people are not getting paid enough. That is not the result of some mysterious cosmic force. It’s the result of bad policy, and we’ve got to change it by raising wages and empowering workers.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Mr. Yang, Mr. Yang.",Dec
Andrew Yang,"GDP and corporate profits are at record highs in America today. Also at record highs, depression, financial insecurity, student loan debt, even suicides and drug overdoses. It has gotten so bad that our life expectancy as a country has declined for the last three years, because suicides and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicle deaths for the first time in American history. The fact is, this unemployment rate and GDP have very little relationship with people’s lived experience on the ground. If you’re a recent college graduate, you have a 40 percent chance of doing a job that doesn’t require a college degree. That doesn’t show up in the headline unemployment rate, nor does all of the families that are working two or three jobs to get by.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Senator Warren, you have your hand up.",Dec
E. Warren,I do.,Dec
Judy Woodruff,And I have a question for you.,Dec
E. Warren,"Well, I want to ask-",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Go ahead-,Dec
E. Warren,This question-,Dec
Judy Woodruff,Go ahead-,Dec
E. Warren,"Because here’s the problem. I’m proud to stand on a stage with Democrats who understand that a rising GDP, rising corporate profits, is not being felt by millions of families across this country. I’m proud to stand on a stage with people who see that America’s middle class is being hollowed out, and that working families and poor people are being left behind.",Dec
E. Warren,"What we need to talk about, though, is why that has happened, and the answer is we’ve got a government that works great for those with money, and doesn’t work for much of anyone else. We have a government that works great for giant drug companies, just not for someone trying to fill a prescription. Works great for people who want to make money at private prisons and private detention centers at our border, just not for the people whose lives are torn apart. Works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, but not for the rest of us, who see climate change bearing down upon us. And when you see a government that works great for the wealthy and the well-connected and for no one else, that is corruption, pure and simple, and we need to call it out for what it is.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"I want… I want Senator Sanders, if you would, a brief response, and then I have another question.",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"Look, here’s the response. Trump goes around saying, “The economy is doing great.” Do you know what, real inflation accounted for, wages went up last year? One point one percent. That ain’t great. Tonight, while three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America, 500,000 Americans, including 30,000 veterans are sleeping out on the streets. Today in America, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth, more income and wealth inequality since the 1920s. We need an economy that works for working families, not just the 1 percent. That is what our campaign is about.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Senator Warren, I have a question for you. Every candidate on the stage has proposed tax increases on the wealthy. But you have especially ambitious plans that, apart from healthcare, would hike taxes an additional eight trillion dollars over the decade, the biggest tax increase since World War II. How do you answer top economists who say taxes of this magnitude would stifle growth and investment?",Dec
E. Warren,"Oh, they’re just wrong. Let’s start with a wealth tax. The idea of a two cent tax on the great fortunes in this country, 50 million dollars and above. For two cents, what can we do? We can invest in the rest of America. We can provide universal childcare, early childhood education for every baby in this country, age zero to five. Universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old and raise the wage.",Dec
E. Warren,"… Pre K for every three-year-old and four-year-old and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher. We can do even more for our public schools, for college graduates, we can cancel student loan debt, but think about the economic impact of that. You leave two cents with the billionaires. They’re not eating more pizzas, they’re not buying more cars. We invest that 2% in early childhood education and childcare. That means those babies get top notch care. It means their mamas can finish their education. It means their mamas in their daddies can take on real jobs, harder jobs, longer hours. We can increase productivity in this country and we can start building this economy from the ground up. That’s how we built it in small towns, that’s how we built it in rural America and that’s how we built it in urban America. An economy that works.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Brief answers.,Dec
E. Warren,"Not from Wall Street, but that works for main stram.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Brief Responses from Mr. Steyer and Mr. Buttigieg.,Dec
Tom Steyer,"Let me say that I agree with Senator Warren in much of what she says. I’ve been for a wealth tax for over a year. I’m in favor of undoing all the tax breaks for rich people and big corporations  that this administration has put through. And in addition, I’ve talked about equilibrating the taxes on passive investment income, which would allow us to cut taxes for 95% of Americans by 10%. But there’s something else going on here that I think is really important, and that’s this. We know Mr. Trump’s going to run on the economy.",Dec
Tom Steyer,"I built a business over 30 years from scratch. We’re going to have to take him on, on the economy in terms of growth as well as economic justice. We’re going to have to be able to talk about growth, prosperity across the board for everyone in America. My experience building a business, understanding how to make that happen means I can go toe to toe with Mr. Trump and take him down on the economy and expose him as a fraud and a failure. And I think that’s different from the other people on this stage. I think we need a different unconventional way of attacking a different unconventional president who actually went after the-",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Mayor.,Dec
Tom Steyer,Best prepared candidate in American history and beat her.,Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Mayor, Buttigieg.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"Right now I think we’re being offered a false choice. You either have to go all the way to the extreme or it’s business as usual. Yes, we must deliver big ideas and yes, taxes on wealthy individuals and on corporations are going to have to go up. We can also be smart about the promises we’re making. Make sure they’re promises that we can keep without the kind of taxation that economists tell us could hurt the economy. It’s why, for example, I propose that we make college free for 80% of Americans, but it doesn’t have to be free for the top. If you’re in that top 10% how you pay your own tuition and we save those dollars for something else that we could spend them on, that would make a big difference. Whether it’s infrastructure, childcare, housing, health. On issue after issue, we’ve got to break out of the Washington mindset that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow Americans it can antagonize.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,We’re going to take a short break and we’ll be right back in two minutes with questions from my fellow moderators.,Dec
Speaker 1,"Welcome back everyone. We are here back at the break in this debate, the first of three breaks. This is a short one. I’m joined by of course, our fantastic panel of analysts and journalists and I want to first ask you, Stephanie Sy and Amy Walter, we hit the two big topics right off the top. Impeachment. Basically president Trump. How do you deal with him and the economy? Let’s start with the economy. That’s the number one issue for voters here. All of these candidates want $15 an hour minimum wage at least eventually, but what differences did we hear? Anything significant?",Dec
Amy Walter,"The difference we heard was at the very end there with Pete Buttigieg saying, we got to make sure that they are promises that we can keep. And going back, something we talked about before the debate began, this sense of breaking away from Elizabeth Warren by saying we can be big, we can be bold, we can have really progressive ideas, but if we look like we are measuring our boldness just in how much tax we are putting on Americans, how big the programs are going to be, that’s just going to come back and hurt the democratic nominee.",Dec
Speaker 1,Stephanie Sy.,Dec
Stephanie Sy,"So first of all, Elizabeth Warren’s answer to Judy’s question. She didn’t answer it directly. She just said, “No, those models are wrong.” There are different economic models of what impact-",Dec
Speaker 1,“What about the economic data that ?” She said “They’re just wrong.”,Dec
Stephanie Sy,"Yeah. And you know, the fact is Wharton at the University of Pennsylvania came out with a budget model just last week and did say that her model in the next 10 years could constrain GDP growth. So there are different models out there. She’s going to have to continue to explain that question. If she makes it into the general election.",Dec
Speaker 1,and she has to also have some details.,Dec
Stephanie Sy,That’s all right.,Dec
Speaker 1,"It looks like candidates might’ve gotten their drinks of water. I hope you did too. And we’re going to go back to the stage momentarily again for the PBS NewsHour, Politico Democratic Debate, many more big issues to come, stay tuned.",Dec
Speaker 1,.,Dec
Speaker 2,"Live from Angeles, the PBS NewsHour, Politico Democratic Debate continues. Once again, Judy Woodruff.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Welcome back to the PBS NewsHour Politico Democratic Presidential Debate. The next question is from Tim Alberta of Politico.,Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thanks Judy. Candidates, good evening. We’re going to talk about climate now. Senator Klobuchar, many scientists say that even if the US reduced its carbon footprint to zero by the year 2050 the damage will have been done. The climate change will have made certain places in the US unlivable. So knowing this, would you support a new federal program to subsidize the relocation of American families and businesses away from places like Miami or Paradise, California, perhaps. Davenport, Iowa. Because we know these places are going to be hit time and time again.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"Well, I very much hope we’re not going to have to relocate entire cities, but we will probably have to relocate some individual residents. And the problem right now is that this climate change is this existential crisis and you are seeing it here in California with the fires that you just had. You saw it in Northern California as was mentioned with Paradise and the most moving video from that to me was a 30 second video of that dad driving his little girl through the lapping fires with his neighborhood burning behind him and singing to her to calm her down.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"We cannot wait to act. There’s an Ojibwe saying that great leaders make decisions, not for this generation, but seven generations from now. This president doesn’t keep his decisions for seven minutes. So what I think we need to do get back into the International Climate Change Agreement. I will do that on day one. On day two, bring back the clean power rules on day three, the gas mileage standards. I see the governor of California who has been working so hard to get those done, defied every step of the way by the Trump administration. And then introduced sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and build a fridge to the next century, which means we must upgrade our buildings and our building standards.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Mr Steyer, would you support such a new federal program again to help subsidize the relocation of these families?",Dec
Tom Steyer,"Look, I am hoping that we in fact will do what I’m suggesting, which is declare a state of emergency on day one of my presidency. I believe I’m the only person here who will say unequivocally, this is my number one priority. I know that we have to deal with this crisis. I know that we have to deal with it from the standpoint of environmental justice. I’ve been working on this for more than a decade. I’ve taken on oil companies and beaten them on environmental laws. I’ve pushed clean energy across this country. I’ve prevented pipelines and I’ve prevented fossil fuel plants.",Dec
Tom Steyer,"But I know is this, not only can we clean up the air and water in the black and brown communities where our pollution is concentrated. This is also the opportunity to create literally millions of middle-class union jobs well-paid across the United States of America. Our biggest crisis is our biggest opportunity and if we don’t declare a state of emergency on day one, I don’t understand how we go to the people around the world to lead the coalition that has to happen and that only America can lead. Look, this is a generational question. I have a lot of respect for the people on this stage. I know everybody is worried about this, but for instance, I would call on Mayor Buttigieg to prioritize this higher. Because the people in his generation understand that this is a crisis that we have to go on right now, but it’s also the greatest opportunity to rebuild and reinvent America.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mr. Buttigieg, 45 seconds to respond.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, I’ve made clear that this will be a topic of day one action, and this is not theoretical for me. I live in one of those river cities that you’re talking about. Not only that, I live right by the river. My neighborhood flooded in the second of two once in a millennium floods that we had in two years. Do the math on that so I know what’s at stake and it’s why I insist that we act with a carbon tax and dividend with massive increases in renewable research on renewable energy, energy storage and carbon storage. But bigger than that, you have to summon the energies of the entire country to deal with this.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"I’ve seen politicians in Washington saying the right thing about climate change for as long as I’ve been alive. All these plans we have to get carbon neutral by 2050, and I think most or all of us have one. Their impact is multiplied by zero unless something actually gets done.",Dec
Tim Alberta,We’d like to switch-,Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"And that is why I want to make sure that our vision for climate includes people from the auto worker down the block from me in South Bend, to a farmer a few minutes away, so that they understand that we are asking, recruiting them to be part of the solution.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,Not beating them over the head and telling them they are part of the problem.,Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We’d like to switch gears slightly. Vice president Biden, I’d like to ask you, three consecutive American presidents have enjoyed stints of explosive economic growth due to a boom in oil and natural gas production. As president, would you be willing to sacrifice some of that growth even knowing potentially that it could displace thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers in the interest of transitioning to that greener economy?",Dec
Joe Biden,"The answer’s yes. The answer’s yes, because the opportunity for those workers to transition to high paying jobs, as Tom said, is real. We’re the only country in the world’s ever taken great, great crises and turned them into an enormous opportunities. I’ve met with the union leaders. For example, we should, in fact, making sure right now that every new building built is energy contained, that it doesn’t leak energy. That in fact we should be providing tax credits for people to be able to make homes turn to solar power where there’s all kinds of folks out here, right here in California. We’re now on the verge of having batteries that are about the size of the top of this podium that you can store energy when in fact the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. We have enormous opportunities. For example, you talk about would we relocate people who in fact we’re in a position where they lost their home.",Dec
Joe Biden,"We have to not rebuild to the standard that existed before when we talk about when we come in and help people. We have to rebuild the standard that exists today. For example, we shouldn’t build another new highway in America that doesn’t have charging stations on it. We have an opportunity to put 550,000 charging stations so that we own the electric vehicle market, creating millions of jobs for people and installing them as well as making sure that we own the electric vehicle market. There’s so many things we can do and we have to make sure we explain it to those people who are displaced, that their skills are going to be needed for the new opportunities.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Vice President Biden. Senator Sanders.",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"Tim, in all due respect, your question misses the mark. It is not an issue of relocating people in towns. The issue now is whether we save the planet for our children and our grandchildren. The issue, as you should know, what the scientists are telling us, is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change. You’re talking about the Paris Agreement, that’s fine. Ain’t enough. We have got to, and I’ve introduced legislation to do this, declare a national emergency. The United States has got to lead the world and maybe, just maybe, instead of spending 1.8 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction, maybe an American president, i.e. Bernie Sanders can lead the world. Instead of spending money to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. Senator Warren, a new question to you, Senator Warren. Many of our Western allies rely heavily on nuclear energy because it’s efficient, affordable, and virtually carbon free. And many climate experts believe that it’s impossible to realize your goal of net zero emissions by the year 2050 without utilizing nuclear energy. So can you have it both ways on this issue?",Dec
E. Warren,"So I see right now is, we’ve got to get the carbon, we’ve got to stop putting more carbon into the air. We’ve got to get the carbon out of the air and out of the water and that means that we need to keep some of our nuclear in place. I will not build more nuclear. I want to put the energy literally and the money and the resources behind clean energy and by increasing by 10 fold what we put into science, what we put into research and development. We need to do what we do best. And that is innovate our way out of this problem and be a world leader. But understand the biggest climate problem we face is the politicians in Washington who keeps saying the right thing, but continue to take money from the oil industry. Continue to bow down to the lobbyist, to the lawyers, to the think tanks to the bought and paid for experts.",Dec
E. Warren,"America understands that we’ve got to make change and we’re running out of time. That climate change threatens every living thing on this planet. But getting Congress to act, they just don’t want to hear it. And if we don’t attack the corruption first, if we don’t attack the corruption head on, then we’re not going to be able to make the changes we need to make on climate, on gun safety, on drug pricing, on all of the big problems that face us. We need a Washington that doesn’t just work for the rich and the powerful. We need one that works for our families.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar, and then I’d like to bring in Senator Yang and Mr. Steyer with the follow ups.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"I wanted to add to what Elizabeth said. So the way we tackle this corruption is by winning big in this election and the way we take on climate change in a big way is by yes, talking about what’s happening on the coast is I just did, but also talking about what’s happening in the Midwest, where I’m from. It’s not fly over country to me, I live there. And what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding. We’re seeing an increase. 50% increase in homeowners insurance over the last few years and when we make these changes, we have to make clear to people that when we put a price on carbon that that money is going to come back to those areas where people are going to be hurt, where jobs are going to change and to make them whole with their energy bills. When you make the case like that, you bring in the Midwestern votes, you win big, and I think the best way to do it is by putting someone at the top of the ticket who’s from the Midwest.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Mr. Yang, 45 seconds on the issue of nuclear energy.",Dec
Andrew Yang,"Well first we should obviously be paying to relocate Americans away from places that are hit by climate change. We’re already doing it. We relocated a town in Louisiana that became uninhabitable because the sea levels rose. And we know that town is not alone. That’s playing out in coastal areas around the country. The question is, do you leave that town on its own to fend for itself or do you come together as a country and say, “We need to protect our people from climate change?” Part of my plan is literally called move people to higher ground. Because that’s what we need to do and that’s literal and figurative. Here in California, it’s forest fires and forest management. And nuclear power, I agree with the research. We need to have everything on the table in a crisis situation, which this is.",Dec
Andrew Yang,"Other countries have had success with nuclear power and the next generation Thoriam reactors have a wealth of potential. Thoriam is not radioactive the way uranium is. It doesn’t last as long and you can’t make a weapon out of it. Whereas if we’re going to innovate our way out of this, as Elizabeth is saying, then we have to have nuclear on the table.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. The last one on the climate to you, Mr. Steyer.",Dec
Tom Steyer,"The point about nuclear power is, it’s not at the stage in the United States where it’s competitive on price. It has a lot of risks to it in terms of disasters and we have no ability to store the toxins that come out of it and last a hundred thousand years. We actually have the technology that we need. It’s called wind and solar and batteries. So in fact, what we need to do, we can do. We’ve got to stop taking a look at this as something that we can’t do because we can do this, and we can do it in a way that rebuilds this country on an accelerated basis. Creates millions of union jobs and we come at it from the standpoint of environmental justice. This is our greatest opportunity to reinvent this country, to actually take on the biggest challenge in history and succeed together. You want to pull the country together with all this partisanship? Let’s take on the biggest challenge in history and succeed together as a nation. That’s what pulls people together.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Amna.",Dec
Amna,"Thanks, Tim. Vice President Biden.",Dec
Joe Biden,Yes.,Dec
Amna,"You’ve been reassuring voters that things will return to normal. Once president Trump leaves office, that Republicans will have what you call an epiphany and come to the table to work with the Biden administration. But given everything that you have seen from current Republicans, what evidence is there that things will change?",Dec
Joe Biden,"Look, I didn’t say return to normal. Normal is not enough. In fact, we would have to move beyond normal, whether it’s healthcare or the environment, whatever it is, we have to build on what we had started in our administration and that’s been interrupted very badly. Number one. Number two, with Trump out of the way, it’s not going to change things in a fundamental way, but what it will do is it will mean that we’re in a position where his base is not going to be able to intimidate those half a dozen Republicans we may need in other things.",Dec
Joe Biden,"I refuse to accept the notion as some on the stage do that we can never, never get to a place where we have cooperation again. If that’s the case, where dead as a country, we need to be able to reach consensus. And if anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate, it’s me the way they’ve attacked me and my son and my family. I have no love. But the fact is, we have to be able to get things done. And when we can’t convince them, we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election in red states and in purple states.",Dec
Amna,"Thank you. Mr Biden. Mr gang, I want to switch topics to you, Mr. Yang, a new question. The democratic party relies on black, Hispanic, and Asian voters. But you are the only candidate of color on the stage tonight and the entire field remains overwhelmingly white. What message do you think this sends to voters of color?",Dec
Andrew Yang,It’s both an honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight.,Dec
Andrew Yang,"…Honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight. I miss Kamala. I miss Cory, though I think Cory will be back. I grew up the son of immigrants and I had many racial epithets used against me as a kid, but black and Latinos have something much more powerful working against them than words. They have numbers. The average net worth of a black household is only 10% that of a white household. For Latinos, it’s 12%. If you’re a black woman, you’re 320% more likely to die from complications in childbirth. These are the numbers that define race in our country. And the question is, why am I the lone candidate of color on this stage? Fewer than 5% of Americans donate to political campaigns. You know what you need to donate to political campaigns? Disposable income.",Dec
Andrew Yang,"The way we fix it… The way we fix this is we take Martin Luther King’s message of a guaranteed minimum income, a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for all Americans. I guarantee, if we had a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month, I would not be the only candidate of color on this stage tonight.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. Senator Sanders, I do want to put the same question to you, Senator Sanders. What message do you think-",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"I will answer that question, but I wanted to get back to the issue of climate change for a moment because I do believe this is the existential issue.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Senator, with all respect, this question is about race. Can you answer the question as it was asked?",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"I certainly can because people of color, in fact, are going to be the people suffering most if we do not deal with climate change. And by the way, we have an obligation up here if there are not any of our African American brothers and sisters up here, to speak about an economy in which African Americans are exploited, where black women die three times at higher rates than white women, where we have a criminal justice system which is racist and broken, disproportionately made up of African Americans and Latinos and Native Americans who are in jail. So we need an economy that focuses on the needs of oppressed, exploited people and that is the African American community.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Thank you, Senator. Yamiche.",Dec
Yamiche,"Thank you, Amna. Senator Klobuchar, here in California, people who identify as Hispanic, black, Asian, or multiracial represent a majority of the population, outnumbering white residents. The United States is expected to be majority non-white within a generation. What do you say to white Americans who are uncomfortable with the idea of becoming a racial minority, even if you don’t share their concerns?",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"I’d say this is America. You’re looking at it. And we are not going to be able to succeed in the world if we do not invite everyone to be part of our economy. Our constitution says that we strive for a more perfect union. Well that’s what we are in doing right now. And to me that means, one, that everyone can vote, and that includes our communities of color. This action that’s been taken by this president and his people and his governors all over the country is wrong. They have made it harder for African Americans to vote. As one court said, “Discriminated with surgical precision.”",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"What would I do as one of the leaders on voting in the US Senate? One, stop the purging. As Stacey Abrams said, you do not stop having your right to assemble if you don’t go to a meeting for a year. Because you don’t go to a church or synagogue or a mosque for three months, you don’t lose your right to worship. You shouldn’t lose your right to vote. I would pass, as president, my bill to register every kid in this country when they turn 18 to vote. That would make all of these discriminatory actions in these states go away and I would stop the gerrymandering, in addition to the agenda of economic opportunity. Because as Martin Luther King says, “What good is it to integrate a lunch counter if you can’t afford a hamburger?”",Dec
Yamiche,"Thank you, Senator. Let’s now turn to the issue of foreign policy and the Middle East. Senator Sanders, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently declared that the United States believes Israeli settlements in the West Bank do not violate international law. That broke decades long US precedent. How would you respond to Israeli expansion of settlements? Would you link that to foreign aid to Israel?",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"Israel has… And I say this is somebody who lived in Israel as a kid, proudly Jewish. Israel has the right, not only to exist, but to exist in peace and security. But what US foreign policy must be about is not just being pro-Israel, we must be pro- Palestinian as well. And whether… In my view. We must understand that right now in Israel we have leadership under Netanyahu, who has recently, as you know, been indicted for bribery. Who in my view is a racist. What we need is a level playing field in terms of the Middle East, which addresses the terrible crisis in Gaza, where 60 or 70% of the young people are unemployed. So what my foreign policy will be about is human rights, is democracy, is bringing people together in a peaceful way, trying to negotiate agreements, not endless wars with trillions of dollars of expenses.",Dec
Yamiche,"Thank you, Senator. Mayor Buttigieg.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"What we are seeing in the Middle East and around the world are the consequences of this president’s failure, this president’s refusal to lead. It’s particularly disturbing in the case of Israel because he has infused domestic politics, making US foreign policy choices in order to effectively interfere in Israeli domestic politics. Acting as though that somehow makes him pro- Israel and pro- Jewish while welcoming white nationalists into The White House.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"But it’s not only in the Middle East that we see the consequences of the disappearance of US leadership. We see among our allies and among our adversaries, case after case, where the world is making plans on what to do, ignoring the United States because we’re no longer considered reliable. It’s not just the mockery at a cocktail party on the sidelines of a conference, it’s the looks on the faces of the leaders at the UN as they looked at the United States President with a mixture of contempt and pity.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"As an American, I never again want to see the American President looked at that way by the leaders of the world. The world needs America right now, but it can’t be just any American. It has to be one that is actually living up to the values that make us who we are. Supporting peace, supporting democracy, supporting human rights and supporting stability around the world.",Dec
Yamiche,"Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Senator Warren, President Obama pledged to close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, but could not. 40 prisoners remain there. Last year, US taxpayers paid $540 million to keep Guantanamo open. Would you pledge to finally close the detention facility and if elected, how will you do it?",Dec
E. Warren,"Yes, it’s time to close this detention facility. It not only costs us money, it is an international embarrassment. We have to be an America that lives our values every single day. We can’t be an America that stands up and asks people to fight alongside us, as we did with the Kurds in fighting ISIS, and then turn around in the blink of a tweet and say that we’re turning our backs on the people who stood beside us. After that, who wants to be an ally of the United States? We have to be an America that understands the difference and recognizes the difference between our allies, the people who will work alongside us, and the dictators who would do us harm. And we need to treat our allies better than we treat the dictators. That needs to be our job as an America.",Dec
E. Warren,"We have the finest military on earth. All three of my brothers served and we have people on this stage who have served and I’m deeply grateful for that. Our military is strong and important, but we need to be an America that relies on our State Department, that relies on diplomacy, that relies on our economic power and that relies on working together with the rest of the world to build a world that is sustainable environmentally and economically for everyone.",Dec
Yamiche,"Thank you, Senator Warren. Vice President Biden. Why couldn’t you close Guantanamo Bay? Why couldn’t the Obama administration close Guantanamo Bay?",Dec
Joe Biden,"We attempted to close Guantanamo Bay, but you have to have congressional authority to do it. They’ve kept it open. And the fact is that we in fact think it’s the greatest… It is an advertisement for creating terror. Look, what we have done around the world in terms of keeping Guantanamo open or what Trump has done by no longer being an honest broker in Israel, there is no solution for Israel other than a two state solution. It does not exist. It’s not possible to have a Jewish state in Middle East without there being a two state solution. And he has played to all the same fears and all the prejudices that exist in this country and in Israel.",Dec
Joe Biden,"Bibi Netanyahu and I know one another well. He knows that I think what he’s doing is outrageous. What we do is we have to put pressure constantly on the Israelis to move to a two state solution, not withdraw a physical aid from them in terms of their security. And lastly, I think that-",Dec
Yamiche,"Thank you, Vice President Biden.",Dec
Joe Biden,"Senator Warren is correct. We have led by, not the example of our power, but the power of our example. And the example we’re demonstrating now is horrible. It’s hurting us badly.",Dec
Yamiche,"Thank you, Vice President Biden. Judy.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"I want to turn to another part of the world and that’s China. Mayor Buttigieg, you have said that you think China presents more of a challenge than do your fellow candidates believe. The US clearly wants China’s cooperation on human rights, on climate change, on North Korea, on terrorism, and yet Americans are appalled by China’s record on human rights, including the detention of over a million Muslim Uyghurs. Should the US, is my question, do more than protest and issue sanctions? Should the US, for example, boycott the 2022 Beijing Olympics?",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"I think that any tool ought to be on the table, especially diplomatic, economic and social tools like what you’re describing. Look, for the president to let it be known that his silence, whether it’s on the rounding up of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, putting them into camps, or the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong for democracy. For him to let China know that his silence can be purchased is trashing American values. The reality is that there’s a lot more to the relationship with China than who’s selling more dishwashers? Yes, we need a much smarter trade policy.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"We also have to acknowledge what’s going on over there. The use of technology for the perfection of dictatorship. That is going to require a stronger than ever response from the US in defense of democracy. But when folks out there standing up for democracy hear not a peep from the President of the United States, what message is that sending to the Chinese Communist Party? The message I will send is that if they perpetrate a repeat of anything like Tienanmen Square when it comes to Hong Kong, they will be isolated from the free world and we will lead that isolation diplomatically and economically.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Mr. Steyer, many Americans have been moved in the last months by the protests of the people of Hong Kong. It is Chinese territory, but what could you, would you do as president if the Chinese government moved in militarily?",Dec
Tom Steyer,"Look, there is a temptation, particularly for this president, to try and answer that in a bilateral way. The way the United States should be reacting in Hong Kong is by gathering our coalition of democracy and freedom loving partners and allies to push back. In fact, when we’re making moral statements around the world, it should not be us threatening and trying to be the world’s policemen. It should be us leading on a value driven basis with the other people who share our values and want to change the world.",Dec
Tom Steyer,"We actually can’t isolate ourselves from China. In fact, we have to work with them as a frienemy. People who disturb us, who we disagree with, but who in effect we are linked to in a world that is ever getting closer. And in fact, if we are going to treat climate as the threat that it is, we are going to have to partner with the Chinese. They are going to have to come along with us. They’re going to have to trust us and together we’re going to have to solve this problem. So the ability to say-",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer.",Dec
Tom Steyer,It’s off the table. We need a good relationship with them. We’re going to have to work with them going forward under all circumstances.,Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden, on China, we now know that China is engaged in an unprecedented military buildup. They have just launched a new aircraft carrier. There are new signs of their disturbing espionage campaign here inside the United States. There are a number of disturbing signs from the Chinese. National security scholars have long warned about the historical precedent that when there’s a ruling power and a rising power, there’s likely to be a war. Is the US on a collision course with China? What steps could you take as president?",Dec
E. Warren,"It’s on a collision course with China but not for war. What we have to make clear is that we in fact are not going to abide by what they’ve done. 1 million Uyghurs, as you pointed out, Muslims, are in concentration camps. That’s where they are right now. They’re being abused. They’re in concentration camps. And what we started in our administration that Trump stopped, we should be moving 60% of our seat power to that area of the world. To let in fact the Chinese understand that they’re not going to go any further. We are going to be there to protect other folks.",Dec
E. Warren,"Secondly, we in fact should make sure that we began to rebuild our alliances, which Trump has demolished, with Japan and South Korea, Australia and Indonesia. We in fact need to have allies who understand that we’re going to stop the Chinese from their actions. We should be gone to the UN immediately and sought sanctions against them and the United Nations for what they did. We have to be firm. We don’t have to go to war but we have to make it clear, “This is as far as you go, China.” And in terms of their military buildup, it’s real but it would take them about 17 years to build up to where we are. We’re not looking for a war but we’ve got to make clear we are Pacific power and we are not going to back away",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Mr. Yang and then Senator Klobuchar.,Dec
Andrew Yang,I have family in Hong Kong. I spent four months there and seeing what’s happening on the streets. It’s shocking. They banned face masks in Hong Kong. Why? Because they have AI technology that now is using facial recognition to identify protesters if they so much as do anything on the street so they can follow up with them and detain them later. This is the rivalry that we have to win where China’s concerned. They’re in the process of leapfrogging us in AI because they have more data than we do and their government is subsidizing it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars.,Dec
Andrew Yang,I have sat with our leading technologists and they say they cannot match the Chinese resources. China just produced its first major smartphone that does not have Google apps and it is now trying to export its technology to the rest of the world. What we have to do is build an international coalition to set technology standards and then you can bring the Chinese to the table in a very real way because this is their top priority and this is where we need to out compete them and win.,Dec
Judy Woodruff,Senator Klobuchar.,Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"When it comes to foreign policy, I think we need to keep our promises and keep our threats. And this president has done neither. And a country like China, they’re leaders, they watch that and they know. He has stood with dictators over innocents. He has stood with tyrants over free leaders. He does it all the time. And I have a little different take than some of my colleagues when it comes to what happened at that conference with NATO. Yeah, they were making fun of him, some of the foreign leaders. I’ve heard senators make more fun of other senators than that. The point of it was that he couldn’t even tolerate it. He is so thin skinned that he walked, he quit. America doesn’t quit.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"So if we want to send a message to the Chinese, we stand with our allies. We stand with them firmly. We have a very clear and coherent foreign policy when it comes to human rights. Check out my website, amyklobuchar.com. I have the five R’s of our foreign policy. About reasserting our values, rejoining international agreements, like the Iranian nuclear agreement. But it all comes down to one R, returning to sanity.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Mayor Buttigieg and then we’re going to take a break.,Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"I’m actually not worried about the president’s bad sense of humor when it comes to being made fun of. I’m worried about the fact that he is echoing the vocabulary of dictators around the world. When the American president refers to unfavorable press coverage as the product of the enemy of the people, democracy around the world gets weaker. Freedom of the press, not just here at home but around the world, gets weaker. It’s one more reminder of what is at stake, not just here at home, but for world history, in the imperative that we win this election.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,Could I respond?,Dec
Pete Buttigieg,This is our chance.,Dec
Judy Woodruff,Very brief. Very brief.,Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"Okay. I just want to make very clear, Mayor, that the freedom of the press is deep in my heart. My dad was a newspaper man. And I am the one that asked every attorney general candidate we’ve had under Donald Trump, both of whom I opposed, about their respect for the First Amendment. And they have refused to follow the rules that Attorney General Holder put in place when it came to protecting our journalists. They would not commit that they wouldn’t put a journalist in jail for doing their job. So this is not just talking points to me, this is the real world. And I think that experience that I will bring to The White House with protecting the First Amendment is worth more than any talking points.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,We’re going to take a short break and we will be…,Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Politico Democratic Presidential Debate. I’m Judy Woodruff, joined by my PBS Newshour colleagues Amna Nawaz and Yamiche Alcindor, by Tim Alberta of Politico. Now, let’s turn to the next question from Tim.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Judy. Candidates, let’s make things interesting. Former President Obama said this week when asked who should be running countries that if women were in charge, you’d see a significant improvement on just about everything. He also said quote, “If you look at the world and look at the problems, it’s usually old people, usually old men, not getting out of the way.”",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Senator Sanders, you are the oldest candidate on stage.",Dec
Bernie Sanders,And I’m white as well.,Dec
Tim Alberta,Yes. How do you respond to what the former president has said?,Dec
Bernie Sanders,"Well, I got a lot of respect for Barack Obama. I think I disagree with him on this one. Maybe a little self-serving, but I do disagree. Here is the issue. The issue is where power resides in America and it’s not white or black or male or female. We are living in a nation increasingly becoming an oligarchy, where you have a handful of billionaires who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and politicians. You have more income and wealth inequality today than at any time since the 1920s. We are the only major country on earth, not to guarantee healthcare for all people, which is why we need Medicare for all. We are facing an existential crisis of climate change. The issue is not old or young, male or female. The issue is working people standing up, taking on the billionaire class, and creating a government and an economy that works for all, not just the 1%.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. Vice President Biden, I’m going to guess that President Obama did not clear that remark through your campaign ahead of time. What do you say to it?",Dec
Joe Biden,I’m going to guess he wasn’t talking about me either.,Dec
Tim Alberta,Okay.,Dec
Joe Biden,"Look, I’m running because I’ve been around. All my experience. With experience, hopefully, comes judgment and a little bit of wisdom. The fact is that we’re in a position now, the next president of the United States is going to inherit two things. Economy that is out of kilter and a domestic policy that needs to be used where we have to unite America and a foreign policy that requires somebody to be able on day one, stand up, look out the entire world, know who that person is, know what they stand for and know they know them. And that’s the reason I’m running. I have more experience in doing that than anybody on this stage.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Just to follow up, Vice president Biden, if elected, you would turn 82 at the end of your first term. You’d be the oldest president in American history.",Dec
Joe Biden,Churchill.,Dec
Tim Alberta,Are you willing to commit … American history.,Dec
Joe Biden,"Oh, American history.",Dec
Tim Alberta,Yes.,Dec
Joe Biden,I was joking. It was a joke.,Dec
Tim Alberta,Okay. I appreciate it.,Dec
Joe Biden,Politico doesn’t have much of a sense of humor.,Dec
Tim Alberta,"Oh, we’ve got a great sense of humor. They wouldn’t have put me on stage otherwise.",Dec
Tim Alberta,Are you willing to commit tonight to running for a second term if you’re elected next November?,Dec
Joe Biden,"No, I’m not willing to commit one way or another. Here’s the deal. I’m not even elected one term yet and let’s see where we are.",Dec
Joe Biden,But it’s a nice thought.,Dec
Tim Alberta,"Senator Klobuchar, you had your hand raised.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"Thank you for asking a woman this question. First of all, we have not had enough women in our government. When I was on Trevor Noah’s show once, I explained how in the history of the Senate, there was something like 2000 men and only 50 women in the whole history and he said if a nightclub had numbers that bad, they would shut it down. However, it is not just about numbers. It’s about what you get done. And that is my argument. If you look at the poll at the state that knows me best, and that is the state of Minnesota, it showed in the state that Hillary had her lowest margin of victory. It showed that I beat Donald Trump by 18 points. I beat him with men more than anyone on this stage. So, I think what matters in this election is can you bring in those rural and suburban areas, particularly in the Midwest? And number two, what will you do when you get there?",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"And I am someone that has passed over 100 bills, with men and women, with Republicans and with Democrats, including changing the sexual harassment laws for the United States Congress. A bill I led, so taxpayers are no longer going to have to pay for people that harass other people. I have passed the law for drug shortages. I have done work in our rural areas. I think that’s what most matters to people. I would be so proud to be the first woman president, but mostly I want to be a president that gets things done and improves people’s lives.",Dec
Tim Alberta,Thank you Senator Klobuchar.,Dec
Tim Alberta,"Senator Warren, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated. I’d like you to weigh in as well.",Dec
E. Warren,"I’d also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated. I believe that President Obama was talking about who has power in America, whose voices get heard. I believe he’s talking about women and people of color and trans people and people whose voices just so often get shoved out. And for me, the best way to understand that is to look at how people are running their campaigns in 2020. I made the decision when I decided to run not to do business as usual. And now I’m crowding in on 100,000 selfies. That’s 100,000 hugs and handshakes and stories. Stories from people who are struggling with student loan debt, stories from people who can’t pay their medical bills, stories from people who can’t find childcare. Now, most of the people on the stage run a traditional campaign and that means going back and forth from coast to coast to rich people and people who can put up 5,000 bucks or more in order to have a picture taken, in order to have a conversation, and in order maybe to be considered to be an ambassador.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Senator Warren.",Dec
E. Warren,"No, I want to finish this. Those selfies cost nobody anything. And I get it. In a democracy, we all have a lot of different points of view and everybody gets one vote. But here’s the thing, people who can put down $5,000 to have a picture taken, don’t have the same priorities as people who are struggling with student loan debt or struggling to pay off medical debt. I’m running a campaign where people whose voices get heard. We can’t have people who can put down $5,000 for a check, drown out the voices of everyone else. They don’t in my campaign and they won’t in my white house.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Senator Warren. Mayor Buttigieg, you had your hand raised.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"I can’t help but feel that might’ve been directed at me and here’s the thing. We’re in the fight of our lives right now. Donald Trump and his allies have made it abundantly clear that they will stop at nothing, not even foreign interference, to hold on to power. They’ve already put together more than $300 million. This is our chance. This is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump. And we shouldn’t try to do it with one hand tied behind our back. The way we’re going to win is to bring everybody to our side in this fight. If that means that you’re a grad student digging deep to go online to peteforamerica.com and chip in 10 bucks, that’s great. And if you can drop $1,000 without blinking, that’s great too. We need everybody’s help in this fight. I’m not going to turn away anyone who wants to help us defeat Donald Trump. We need Democrats who’ve been with us all along, yes, but we also need independents worried about the direction of the country. If you were Republican, disgusted with what’s going on in your own party, we’re not going to agree on everything, but we need you in this fight and I will welcome you to our side.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Senator Warren, 45 seconds to respond.",Dec
E. Warren,"So, the mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900 a bottle wine. Think about who comes to that. He had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open door, but this one was closed door. We made the decision many years ago that rich people in smoke-filled rooms would not pick the next president of the United States. Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Mr. Mayor, your response.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"You know, according to Forbes magazine, I am literally the only person on this stage who’s not a millionaire or a billionaire. This is important. This is the problem with issuing purity tests, you cannot yourself pass. If I pledge never to be in the company of a progressive democratic donor, I couldn’t be up here. Senator, your net worth is 100 times mine. Now, supposing that you went home feeling the holiday spirit, I know this isn’t likely but stay with me, and decided to go on to Pete for america.com and give the maximum allowable by law $2,800. Would that pollute my campaign because it came from a wealthy person? No. I would be glad to have that support. We need the support from everybody who is committed to helping us defeat Donald Trump.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"We would like to bring another one, but obviously Senator Warren, I’d like to give you a chance to respond.",Dec
E. Warren,I do not sell access to my time. I don’t do call-time with millionaires and billionaires.,Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"Hold on a sec. Sorry, as it went Senator-",Dec
E. Warren,"I don’t meet behind closed doors with big dollar donors and look, I’ve taken one that ought to be an easy step for everyone here. I’ve said to anyone who wants to donate to me, if you want to donate to me, that’s fine, but don’t come around later expecting to be named ambassador because that’s what goes on in these high dollar fundraisers. I said no and I asked everybody on this stage to join me. This ought to be an easy step and here’s the problem. If you can’t stand up and take the steps that are relatively easy, can’t stand up to the wealthy and well-connected when it’s relatively easy when you’re a candidate, then how can the American people believe you’re going to stand up to the wealthy and well-connected when you’re president and it’s really hard.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"Senator, I’ve got to respond to this.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Mr. Mayor, we’re going to give you one more chance to respond.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"First of all, if you can’t say no to a donor, then you have no business running for office in the first place. But also, Senator, your presidential campaign right now as we speak, is funded in part by money you transferred, having raised it at those exact same big ticket fundraisers you now denounce. Did it corrupt you, Senator? Of course not. So, to denounce the same kind of fundraising guidelines that president Obama went by, that Speaker Pelosi goes by, that you yourself went by until not long ago in order to build the democratic party and build a campaign ready for the fight of our lives, these purity tests shrink the stakes of the most important election upon us.",Dec
Tim Alberta,We’d like to bring everyone in. We’d like to bring everyone in.,Dec
E. Warren,He addressed me directly.,Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"I did not come here to listen to this argument. I came here to make a case for progress and I have never even been to a wine cave. I’ve been to the Wind Cave in South Dakota, which I suggest you go to. So, what is making a case for progress about? That is what unites us up here instead of what divides us, which is campaign finance reform. That means passing a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. It means making the first bill we pass when I am president will be HR1 which is the ethics reform passed in the house, which is currently sitting on Mitch McConnell’s desk along with 400 bills. And if you don’t think we can get this done, well we can, but only if we win this election big. Not by arguing with each other but by finding what united us in getting it done. I came to make a case for progress.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Sanders.",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"I am rather proud, maybe, I don’t know. The only candidate up here doesn’t have any billionaire contributions, but you know what I do have? We have received more contributions from more individuals than any candidate in the history of the United States of America at this point in an election, averaging $18 a piece. Now there’s a real competition going on up here. My good friend Joe, and he is a good friend, he’s received contributions from 44 billionaires. Pete, on the other hand is trailing. Pete, you only got 39 billionaires contributing. So Pete, we look forward to you. I know you’re an energetic guy and a competitive guy to see if you could take on Joe on that issue. But what is not a laughing matter, my friends. This is why three people own more wealth than the bottom half. This is why Amazon and other major corporations pay zero in federal taxes. We need to get money out of politics. We should run our campaigns on that basis.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. Vice President Biden. 45 seconds to respond.",Dec
Joe Biden,"My average contribution is $43, number one. That’s number one. Number two, the idea that the senator’s suggesting that I’m in the pocket of billionaires, when in fact they oppose everything that I’ve ever done and continue to do. I have made sure from the very beginning, every one of my fundraisers is open to the press. Every single solitary one, not one single time period. And I’ve made sure that you know exactly where all the … and the largest contribution I’ve accepted is $2,800, which is allowed under the law. And I’m the first person to introduce the constitutional amendment to make sure that there is now all public funding of elections. End all private funding. And we all should make a commitment of that right now on this stage. In the meantime, you got to fund a campaign and we in fact have funded a campaign average contribution, $43.",Dec
Tim Alberta,"Thank you, vice president.  I would like to bring you in.",Dec
Bernie Sanders,Can I-,Dec
Tom Steyer,"Listen, I’m running because this government is broken because it’s purchased by corporations and I’ve spent 10 years fighting those corporations and beating them and building grassroots organizations to push power down to the people. That’s what I’ve been doing for a decade. But let me say this, there’s someone who’s loving this conversation and his name is Donald Trump.",Dec
Bernie Sanders,That’s right.,Dec
Tom Steyer,"We know how he’s going to run. He’s told us last week, he looked at a group of Americans and said, “I don’t like you. You don’t like me. It doesn’t matter. You’re going to support me because the Democrats will destroy the economy in 15 minutes.” We need to go after this guy. He’s a different breed of cat and we need to beat him and we need to talk about prosperity. And I spent 25 years building a business. We’re going to have to take him on the economy, not have these kinds of conversations and tear each other down, but actually go after this corrupt president and beat him on the economy where he thinks he’s king and where in fact he’s a fraud and a failure.",Dec
Tim Alberta,Thank you Mr. Steyer. We’re going to end it there. Amna?,Dec
Amna Nawaz,"I want to turn now to an issue that’s been in the headlines quite a bit and that is immigration. Mr. Yang, we have a question here from a professor right here at Loyola Marymount. There are nearly 200,000 DACA recipients, so-called DREAMers, in the state of California more than any other state, including several students right here at LMU. If you win and you reinstate DACA through executive action, another president could just overturn it again. So, will you move on a permanent legislative fix for DREAMers in your first 100 days if elected?",Dec
Andrew Yang,"Of course, I would. I’m the son of immigrants myself and I know that DREAMers are essentially Americans in everything but this legal classification. I just want to return to this conversation because I think it’s core. Our country is deeply misogynist and most all of us know that. Money and men are tied together. That’s where I thought Elizabeth was taking the conversation. The fact is, strong societies would elect more female leaders. Strong men treat women well for the same reasons. I’m on the record saying that you need both strong men and female leaders in government because the fact is if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for a while, we kind of become morons.",Dec
Andrew Yang,"So, it’s related to our campaign finance rules because right now the fact is we operate in a fundamentally anti-woman marketplace, and that includes the marketplace for politicians. If we were to put a hundred democracy dollars into the hands of every American voter, instead of 5% contributing, you’d see that rate skyrocket to 50 or 60% and you’d have many, many more women who would run for office because they don’t have to go shake the money tree in the wine cave.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Thank you Mr. Yang. I’d like to follow up. The question again, Mr. Yang-",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,Can I address immigration reform?,Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Was about DREAMers. You pledge to move on a permanent legislative fix in your first 100 days. DREAMers say that they are frustrated by Democrats’ failure to prioritize their status in deal after deal. So, why should DREAMers trust Democrats now?",Dec
Andrew Yang,"I believe everyone on this stage would do the right thing by DREAMers in the first hundred days. I would make it a top priority. I’m the son of immigrants myself. The fact is almost half of fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or children of immigrants. Immigrants make our country stronger and more dynamic. And immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have absolutely nothing to do with. If you go to the factory in Michigan, it’s not wall to wall immigrants. It’s wall to wall robot arms and machines. We have to send the opposite message of this administration and, as your a president, I think I could send a very clear message, where if you’re considering immigrating to this country and I’m the president, you would realize my son or daughter can become president of the United States. That’s the opposite of the current administration and that’s the message I would love to send to the world.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Thank you, Mr. Yang. Senator Sanders, I have a new question for you. You can respond to Mr. Yang’s comments as well.",Dec
Bernie Sanders,I can’t respond to the immigration question?,Dec
Amna Nawaz,"This is related, sir, but there are estimated to be as many as 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. More than 2 million right here in California. If you have a chance to forge a bipartisan immigration reform plan, would you insist on a path to citizenship for all 12 million or just a segment of that population?",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"No. This is what I would do. Day one executive order restore the legal status of 1.8 million young people in the DACA program. Day one we change border policy so that federal agents will never snatch babies from the arms of their mothers. Day one. Day one we introduce bipartisan legislation, which will, in fact, be comprehensive, which will result in a path toward citizenship for all of the 11 million who are undocumented. That is what the people of our country want. Trump thinks mistakenly that he is going to win reelection by dividing us up. We are going to win this election by bringing our people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American. That’s what this campaign is about. That’s what America must be about.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,Senator Klobuchar.,Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"Thank you. I started my day today with a group of immigrants who are there talking to me about housing and I thought about this president and what he’s done. He has used our immigrants as political pawns. Every single day, he tries to draw a wedge. I will be a different president. My view on this comes from experience. When I got to the Senate, Senator Kennedy asked me to be one of the two new senators that was in the group to work on the immigration reform package. We got so close to passing that. I voted for it. Not everyone did, but most of the Democrats did. Then I was on the judiciary committee when President Obama was president and we worked very hard on that immigration reform. We actually passed that with Republican votes. Then I was in the small group that worked on the compromise on the DREAMers, that would have solved that problem. We didn’t get that done because this president gut-punched us.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Thank you, Senator.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,I will take my views. I will take this experience. I will get this done because immigrants don’t diminish America. They are America.,Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Thank you, Senator. Mr. Steyer, briefly, your response.",Dec
Tom Steyer,"Listen, I think it’s important to note that this president is not against immigration. He’s against immigration by non-white people.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,Yes.,Dec
Tom Steyer,"This is his attempt to divide us, as Senator Sanders said, on race. And that’s what he’s been doing since the very first day he started running for president. He’s been vilifying non-white people. He’s been trying to inflame his base and scare them that if in fact white people lose control of this country, that they’re going to lose control of their lives. And as somebody who lives in a majority-minority state, which is California, what he’s doing is so wrong on so many different levels. I agree with Senator Sanders. We have to reframe this argument completely. We have to go back to the idea that every American is worth being a full human being on every right. This is a racial argument by a racist president who’s trying to divide us and who’s vilifying people. It’s absolutely wrong and it’s led him to break the laws of humanity in our name.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mayor Buttigieg, a new question to you, Mr. Mayor. You said last month that the U.S. owes compensation to children separated from their families at the Southern border. The consensus among child welfare experts is that those thousands of children will likely suffer lifelong trauma as a result of that separation. Are you committing, as president, to financial compensation for those thousands of children?",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"Yes, and they should have a fast track to citizenship because what the United States did under this president to them was wrong and we have a moral obligation to make right what was broken. And on the larger issue of immigration, my understanding of this issue isn’t theoretical. It’s not something I formed in committee rooms in Washington. It begins with the fact that my household, my family came from abroad. My father immigrated to this country and became a U.S. Citizen. It comes from the fact that I’m the mayor of a city where neighborhoods that were left for dying are now coming back to life, largely because of the contributions mainly of Latino immigrants.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"…Largely because of the contributions mainly of Latino immigrants. And I’ve seen those same neighborhoods shut down. Families huddling in church, panicking just because of the rumor of an ice raid that does not make our country safe.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,Could I respond.,Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"Just to look into the eyes of an eight year old boy whose father was deported even though he had nothing so much as a traffic ticket against his name and try to think of something to tell that boy because I couldn’t tell him what he most wanted to hear, which is just that he was going to have his dad back. How can harming that young man possibly make America safer.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Mr. Mayor, just-",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"When I am president? Based on those experiences, I will make sure that this is a country of laws and of values and that means not only ending these unspeakable frugal practices at the border, but finally and truly fixing the immigration system that has needed, a full overhaul since the 1980s.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,Mr. Mayor.,Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"We cannot wait four years, 10 years. We cannot wait anymore to do something about this.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Thank you Mr. Mayor. Just to follow-up, since you do support compensation for those families, should the US also compensate descendants of enslaved people? Do you support reparations for African Americans?",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"I support H.R. 40 which is the bill that has been proposed in Congress to establish a commission to look at reparations, but we shouldn’t wait for that commission to do its work to do things that are reparative. Remember we’re not talking about a gift to anybody. We’re talking about mending what was broken. We’re talking about the generational theft of the wealth of generations of African Americans. And just crossing out or racist policy and replacing it with a neutral one is not enough to deliver a quality harms compound just like a dollar saved in its value compounds over time. So does the value of a dollar stolen and that is why the United States must act immediately with investments in minority owned businesses with investments in health equity, with investments in HBCUs and on the longer term a look at reparations so that we can mend what has been broken.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Vice president Biden, do you support reparations?",Dec
Joe Biden,"Not any, since I haven’t spoken on this. Got a chance. Number one, the reason we’re the country we are is because of immigration. We’ve been able to cherry-pick the best from every single continent. The people that come here have determination, resilience. They are ready to stand up and work like the devil. We had a 24 out of every 100 children in our school today is Hispanic. The idea that we are going to walk away and not provide every opportunity for them is not only stupid and immoral but as bad for America. They are the future of America and we should invest in them. Everybody will be benefit from it. Every single American and you should get used to it. This is a nation of immigrants. That’s who we are. That’s why we are who we are. That’s what makes us different and we should invest in them.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Thank you Mr. Biden. Senator Klobuchar, sorry you had your hand up.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"I was hearkening back… I made my case on immigration to what the mayor said about Washington. So I look at this a different way. When we were in the last debate mayor, you basically mocked the 100 years of experience on the stage and what do I see on this stage? I see Elizabeth’s work starting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and helping 29 million people. I see the vice president’s work in getting a $2 billion for his cancer moonshot. I see Senator Sanders’ work working to get the veterans bill passed across the aisle and I see what I’ve done, which is to negotiate three farm bills and be someone that actually had major provisions put in those bills. So what you can dismiss committee hearings. I think this experience works and I have not denigrated your experience as a local official. I have been one-",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"You know, sorry.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,I just think you should respect our experience when you look at how you evaluate someone who can get things done.,Dec
Amna Nawaz,Thank you Senator. Mr. Mayor I’ll give you a chance to respond.,Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"You actually did denigrate my experience Senator and it was before the break and I was going to let it go cause we got bigger fish to fry here. But, you implied that my relation-",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"Oh, I don’t think we have bigger fish to fry than picking a president of the United States.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"You’re right, and before the break you seemed to imply that my relationship to the First Amendment was a talking point. As if anyone up here has any more or less commitment to the constitution than anybody else up here. Let me tell you about my relationship to the First Amendment. It is part of the Constitution that I raised my right hand and swore to defend with my life. That is my experience and it may not be the same as yours, but it counts, senator, it counts.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,Thank you Mr. Mayor. Senator Klobuchar this time you have 45 seconds to respond.,Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"I certainly respect your military experience. That’s not what this is about. This is about choosing a president and I know my view of this is I know you ran for to be chair of the Democratic National Committee. That’s not something that I wanted to do. I want to be president of the United States. And the point is we should have someone heading up this ticket that has actually won and been able to show that they can gather the support that you talk about of moderate Republicans and Independents as well as a fired-up democratic base. And not just done at once, I have done it three times. I think winning matters. I think a track record of getting things done matters and I also think showing our party that we can actually bring people with us, have a wider tent, have a bigger coalition and yes, longer coattails that matters.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Thank you Senator, finished.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"I’ve got to respond to that. Senator I know that if you just go by vote totals, maybe what goes on in my city seems small to you. If you want to talk about the capacity to win, try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with 80% of the vote as a gay dude and Mike Pence’s Indiana.",Dec
Amna Nawaz,.,Dec
Amy Klobuchar,If you had won in Indiana that would be one thing. You tried and you lost by 20 points.,Dec
Bernie Sanders,"Let’s talk about how… Excuse me, let’s talk about how we win an election, which is something everybody here wants to do in terms of defeating the most dangerous president in American history. So let me tell you how you’re win it. You have the largest voter turnout in the history of America. And you don’t have the largest voter turnout unless you create energy and excitement. And you know, create energy and excitement unless you are prepared to take on the people who own America and are prepared to speak to the people who are working in America. We need a progressive agenda. Medicare for all, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, leading the world in combating climate change, making public colleges and universities-",Dec
Amna Nawaz,Thank you-,Dec
Bernie Sanders,available to all because we have free tuition or intensely Oh student debt in this country.,Dec
Yamiche A.,"Thank you Senator Sanders. I’d like to turn to a new subject. And that is of course education. Senator Warren, you propose free public college tuition and student loan forgiveness for most families. Why should wealthy families be able to send their kids to public college for free? Why not concentrate that government help on those most in need?",Dec
E. Warren,"So as I’ve talked about before, I have a 2 cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires and that gives us enough money to invest in all of our babies age zero to five. To put an historic $800 billion investment in public schools, K through 12 and that will permit us to offer technical school 2-year college, 4-year college for every single person who wants an education. Cancel student loan debt four 50…. Put a $50 billion investment in our historically black colleges and universities and cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans.",Dec
E. Warren,"Look, this is about money, but this is also about values. We need to make an investment in our future and the best way to do that is let’s invest in the public education of our children. That starts when they’re babies and it goes long after high school. We want to have families. I meet families every day in the selfie lines who talk about what it means to be crushed by student loan debt. That’s why I have a proposal, popular among Democrats, popular among Republicans, popular among independents to ask those at the top to pay a little more. So somebody can get rid of that student loan debt so they can make an investment in themselves. Start a small business, buy a car, create a future for themselves and for this country.",Dec
Yamiche A.,"Thank you, Senator. I see some hands, but I want to go to Mayor Buttigiege. Mayor Buttigiege, your plan offers free or discounted public college only to families making up to $150,000 a year. Do you think Senator Warren’s plan offers free college to too many families?",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"I do think that if you’re in that lucky top 10% I still wish you, well, don’t get me wrong, I just want you to go ahead and pay your own tuition. Now we can still have public service loan forgiveness for those who go into lower income fields to deal with that. But if you’re not top 10% I think you’re going to be for the most part. Okay? And there is a very real choice on where every one of these tax dollars goes. So I very much agree with Senator Warren on raising more tax revenue from millionaires and billionaires. I just don’t agree on the part about spending it on millionaires and billionaires when it comes to their college tuition.",Dec
E. Warren,"So wait, he mentioned me by name.",Dec
Yamiche A.,"Thank you, Mayor. Thank you Mayor Buttigiege, I want to… I’m going to let you respond senator Warren.",Dec
E. Warren,"Look, the mayor wants billionaires to pay one tuition for their own kids. I want a billionaire to pay enough to cover tuition for all of our kids because that’s how we build a future. The other part is we’ve got to deal with student loan debt, and right now most of the people on the stage are nibbling around the edges of a huge student loan debt burden that disproportionately affects people of color. African Americans are more likely to have to borrow money to go to school, more likely to borrow more money while they’re in school and have a harder time paying it off. We want to make an investment in the future then open up education for all of our kids. That’s how we build our future.",Dec
Yamiche A.,Thank you senator. Senator Sanders you can nor respond to it.,Dec
Bernie Sanders,"I believe in the concept of universality and one of the crises in America today is people are sick and tired of filling out forms. So you’re not eligible for the program today because you’re at 150 but you’ll lost your job by eligible. You’ve got a better job, you’re eligible. I think what we have to do is what we do with social security, what we do with public education. Donald Trump’s kids can go to a public school, they should be able to go to a public school. What we all need right now is a revolution in education. We have got to en this dysfunctional childcare system and make that every working class person in this country can find high quality, affordable childcare. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. And by taxing billionaires and by taxing wall street, we will cancel all student debt in this country.",Dec
Yamiche A.,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. Tim.",Dec
Tim,"Switching gears here, Mr.Steyer, earlier this year in Iowa I met a father, Bill stumps and his son Kyle and Dubuque. Kyle is a remarkable young adults with significant disabilities and though he’s been employed for about five years at a local pizza parlor, the future is very uncertain for his family. Bill worries that there aren’t enough jobs, living facilities, social programs designed to meet the needs of his son. So I’m wondering as president, are there specific steps that you would take to help people like Kyle become more integrated into the workforce and into their local communities?",Dec
Tom Steyer,"Look, the United States has made a commitment to treat everybody equally and that means supporting people with disabilities both in terms of education and later when they’re part of the workforce. That means bringing the resources to bear to make sure that we’re treating them fairly in school and after school to try and integrate them fully and to make them have as full a life as possible.",Dec
Tom Steyer,"The question we’ve got here across the board is can we afford to do the kinds of things that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren are pushing? And the answer is yes, but in fact what we need to do is to undo the tax breaks that have been given for two generations to rich Americans and big corporations last year the top 400 corporations paid an 11% tax. That is absolutely ludicrous.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,Could I answer the crisis?,Dec
Tom Steyer,"the answer on disability is a question of focus and money as so many of these questions are, we have a country where the government is broken because corporations have bought it. They’re getting their way and for us to get back to government of by and for the people that serves Americans, including Americans with disabilities. We’re going to have to take that back. For the sake-",Dec
Tim,Mr. Yang I didn’t hear a specific answer from Mr. Steyer. Can you outline specific steps that the government should take to help integrate these young people into the workforce and into their local communities?,Dec
Andrew Yang,"I would love it. I have a son with special needs and to me special needs is the new normal in this country. How many of you all have a family member or a friend or a neighbor with special needs or autism? If you look around, most hands went up. The fact is right now we have to do more for Kyle. Special needs children are going to become special needs adults in many cases. And here’s the challenge. We go to employers and say, Hey, this special needs person can be a contributor in your workplace, which may be correct, but that’s not the point. We have to stop confusing economic value in human value. We have to be able to say to our kids and Kyle that you have intrinsic value because you are an American and you are a human being.",Dec
Andrew Yang,"We’re going to put a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month in everyone’s hands, which is going to help families around the country adapt and then we’re going to take this burden off of the communities and off of the schools who do not have the resources to support kids like my son and make it a federal priority, not a local one. So not not robbing Peter to pay Paul.",Dec
Tim,Thank you Mr. Yang. We have to move on. Judy.,Dec
E. Warren,No. Come on.,Dec
Tim,"Senator Warren, 45 seconds.",Dec
E. Warren,"So I was a special education teacher and I loved that work because it gave me a chance to work straight up with people to recognize the worth of every human being. I had four to 46-year-olds who were in special ed and what do we need to do? That’s why I have a plan as a special ed teacher to fully fund IDEA, so every child with disabilities will get the full education they need.",Dec
E. Warren,"My housing plan is about investing in more housing across this country and rural America and urban America in small town America, but it’s also about making sure that people who want to live independently, people who have disabilities will have housing available to them. I make a part of my job to spill that we are going to make sure as president, I will make sure that the people who want to bid on federal contracts are treating people with disabilities fairly and paying them fairly. You’ve got to go at it at every part of what we do because as a nation, this is truly a measure of who we are. We believe in treating these the least of thy brethren as people of value, and that is how we make a better America.",Dec
Tim,Thank you. Senator Warren. Judy.,Dec
Judy,"I know we have a lot of hands up. We have so many important topics to discuss. I want to come to you, Senator Klobuchar on a question of the judges. President Trump has appointed, as we know, two Supreme court justices, but he’s also had confirmed nearly 200 federal judges, most of whom are young and could shape American law for decades to come. Some of them you voted for in the Senate, including one who just yesterday joined a ruling to strike down a key part of the affordable care act would president Trump’s appointees, my question is, make it harder for you as president for any of you on this stage to enact your agenda.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"Of course. And I want to make it clear that I’ve opposed many, many judges and I think everyone will remember what happened at the Kavanaugh Hearing when that nominee went after me. I stood my ground and he had to apologize. So I have been very strong on these judges. As for the judge you just referred to, there was actually the judge that wrote the opinion was a, that went through the Senate unanimously with support by Senator Sanders with support by President Obama with support by then Senator Kennedy. So I think it is very important when we look at these judges to acknowledge that there are some of these judges that you think are going to be okay and they aren’t, but what would I do as president? I would appoint judges that are in the vein of people like Elena Kagan and justice Pryor and Sonia Sotomayor, and let’s not forget the notorious RBG. That’s what I would do.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"And if you look at my record as a lawyer and a member of the Judiciary committee, look at the judges that I recommended to President Obama. People like Mimi Wright who’s a superstar, and Susan Richard Nelson, look at who I put in as the first openly gay Marshall in the history of the United States. I did that because I knew they were qualified people to take those jobs and you need to do it not only with the right judges and have that knowhow, but you also have to do it right away. That is one thing that we all learn from when president Obama was in and that was that he was dealing with an economic crisis and it was hard to do it right away, but we have to immediately start putting judges on the bench to fill vacancies so that we can reverse the horrific nature of these Trump judges.",Dec
Judy,"A followup to mayor Buttigiege. Beyond a pledge not to overturn Roe versus Wade, which I believe all of you have said would be part of your decision making and choosing a nominee to the court. Are there other litmus tests that you would apply in choosing federal judges?",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"The Supreme court is very personal for me because my household, my marriage, exists by the grace of a single vote on that body, and yes, it is critical that we have justices who understand that American freedom includes reproductive rights and reproductive freedom, but that’s not all. I expect an understanding that voting rights are human rights. I expect an understanding that equality is required of us all and I expect a level of respect for the rule of law that prevents this body from coming to be viewed as just one more partisan battlefield, which is why I will not only appoint judges and justices who reflect this worldview, but also begin moving to reform the body itself as our country has done at least half a dozen times in its history. So that it is not one more political battlefield every single time a vacancy comes up.",Dec
Judy,Yamiche.,Dec
Yamiche A.,"Senator Sanders, at least 22 transgender people were killed in the United States this year. Most of them transgender women of color. Each of you have said you would push for the passage of the Equality Act, a comprehensive LGBTQ Civil Rights Bill. But if elected, what more would you do to stop violence against transgender people?",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"We need moral leadership in the white house. We need a president who will do everything humanly possible to end all forms of discrimination against the transgender community, against the African American community, against the Latino community, and against all minorities in this country. But above and beyond providing the moral leadership of trying to bring our people together. What we also need for the transgender community is to make sure that health care is available to every person in this country, regardless of their sexual orientation or their needs. And that is why I strongly support and have helped lead the effort for a Medicare for all single payer program, which will provide comprehensive healthcare to all people, including certainly the transgender community.",Dec
Yamiche A.,"Thank you, Senator Sanders. Senator Warren.",Dec
E. Warren,"The transgender community has been marginalized in every way possible. And one thing that the president of the United States can do is lift up attention, lift up their voices, lift up their lives. Here’s a promise I made. I will go to the Rose Garden once every year to read the names of transgender women of people of color who have been killed in the past year. I will make sure that we read their names so that as a nation we are forced to address the particular vulnerability on homelessness. I will change the rules now that put people in prison based on their birth sex identification rather than their current identification. I will do everything I can to make sure that we are in America that leaves no one behind.",Dec

Amna Nawaz,"Yes sir, Afghanistan.",Dec
Joe Biden,.,Dec
Amna Nawaz,"As vice president, what did you know about the state of the war and do you believe that you were honest with the American people about it?",Dec
Joe Biden,"The reason I can speak to this, it’s well known, if any of you followed my view on Afghanistan, I was sent by the president before we got sworn in to Afghanistan to come back with a report. I said there was comprehensive policy available and then I got in a big fight for a long time with the Pentagon because I strongly opposed the nation building notion. We set about rebuilding that country as a, as a whole nation is beyond our capacity. I argued from the very beginning that we should have a policy that was based on an anti-terrorism policy with a very small footprint that in fact only had special forces to deal with potential threats from that territory to the United States of America.",Dec
Joe Biden,The first thing I would do as president the United States of America is to make sure that we brought all combat troops home and into a negotiation with the Taliban. But I would leave behind special forces in small numbers to be able to deal with the potential threat unless we got a real good negotiation accomplished to deal with terrorism. That’s been my position from the beginning. That’s why I think secretary Gates and some members of the Pentagon weren’t happy with me.,Dec
Amna Nawaz,"Mr. Biden. The question was about your time in the white house though, and in that Washington Post report, there’s a senior national security official who said that there was constant pressure from the Obama white house to produce figures showing the troop surge was working, and I’m quoting from the report here, “Despite hard evidence to the contrary.” What do you say to that?",Dec
Joe Biden,Since 2009…,Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"Hard evidence to the contrary, what do you say to that?",Dec
Joe Biden,"Since 2009 go back and look, I was on the opposite side of that with the Pentagon.  I can speak to it now is because it’s been published. It’s been published thoroughly. I’m the guy, from the beginning, who argued that it was a big, big mistake to surge forces to Afghanistan, period. We should not have done it and I argued against it constantly.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,Senator Sanders you had your hand up?,Dec
Bernie Sanders,"In all due respect to Joe. Joe, you’re also the guy who helped lead us into the disastrous war in Iraq. What we need to do, is I think, rethink and the Washington post piece was very educational. What we need to rethink, is the entire war on terror? We have lost thousands of our own men and women, brave soldiers. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, have been killed abroad or forced to leave their countries. It is time right now, that we bring this world together, to try to end these endless wars and address the root causes, which are causing these wars.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"Senator Sanders, you do often point to your vote against the war in Iraq is evidence of your judgment on foreign policy. But you did vote for the war in Afghanistan and as recently as 2015 you said you supported a continued U. S. Troop presence there. Was that support a mistake?",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"00 AM in the morning or dessert your long time allies like the Kurds. I think you work with the international community, you remove all troops over a period of time, a short period of time within one year.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"Thank you, Senator. Mayor Buttigieg, you served in this war, but I want to ask about your decision making if you were elected Commander in Chief. You have pledged to withdrawal all U.S. troops from a Afghanistan within your first year as president. But the Taliban today control or contest more than half the country. So should you, as president, still withdrawal all those U. S. Troops if the country could once again become a Haven for terrorists.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"We’re going to leave one way or the other. The question is to make sure we do it well and not poorly. And of course that has to respond to the conditions on the ground and the need for a political settlement. But the other day I was reunited with somebody that I served with over there and the thing we were, marveling at is how long it’s been since we left. I thought I was one of the last troops turning out the lights when I left years ago and we’re still there. There may need to be some kind of limited special operations and intelligence capacity. The exact same kind of thing by the way that we actually had in Syria, holding the line before the president yanked it out leading to the road to chaos. But what we know is that we cannot go on with these endless wars.",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"And I’m glad that the name of Barbara Lee was mentioned, not only because of what she’s talked about years ago. I believe that we had no choice but to go to Afghanistan after 9/11 but right now, she is one of the leaders of the effort to repeal and replace the authorization for the use of military force and the folks that I served with deserve that. They deserve the clarity of members of Congress being able to summon the courage, to take an up or down vote on whether they ought to be there in the first place and when I am president, anytime if I am forced to deploy troops into war, anytime we seek an authorization, it will have a three year sunset. So that if there really does have to be a conversation about extending it, it has to be brought to Congress, brought to the American people, and those members of Congress have to take that tough up or down vote.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,Thank you Mr mayor. Tim.,Dec
Tim,"Thanks. Moving to healthcare. An issue that voters tell us every day is still the number one priority for them. Senator Sanders, you’ve spent plenty of time discussing and defending the merits of your Medicare for all plan. But the reality is that, if Republicans retain control of the U S Senate or even if Democrats win back a narrow Senate majority, your plan as constituted probably would not have the votes to pass Congress. So the question Senator is, if Congress rejects your plan and the American people are looking to you for leadership on this issue, are there smaller specific measures that you would take immediately to expand coverage and decrease costs as president?",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"Well Tim, at a time when we’re spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as any other nation. When 87 million people are uninsured or under insured. When 30,000 people are dying each year because they don’t get to a doctor when they should and what a half a million people are going bankrupt because of the dysfunctional and cruel system that we currently have. You know what? I think we will pass a Medicare for all, single payer system.",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"And I will introduce that legislation in my first week in office. Now to answer your question, I think when we go out to the American people and tell them, that right now, we have got to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, for example. Which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same exact drug as it’s charged in this country. Where the American people understand that Medicare for all expands Medicare to cover home health care, dental care, eyeglasses, and hearing AIDS and does it at a cost far, far lower than what some of my opponents are talking about. You know what? We’re going to have the American people behind us. We will have Congress behind it.",Dec
Tim,"Thank you. Senator Sanders, Vice President Biden. I’d like to bring you in. You spent an awful lot of time 10 years ago trying to pass a bill, far less ambitious than what Senator Sanders is talking about here. Is he being realistic?",Dec
Joe Biden,"I don’t think it is realistic, but let me explain why. I introduced a plan to build on Obamacare. It remind everybody, 20 million people got insurance, didn’t have it before. All people with preexisting conditions are able to be covered. I could go on. We didn’t get all that we wanted, but now that it’s been exposed, that taking it away has such dire consequences. I’ve added to the Obamacare plan, the Biden Initiative, which is a public option. Medicare, if you want to have Medicare.for reducing significantly the price of drugs, deductibles, et cetera by underwriting the plan to a tune of about $750 billion dollars. And making sure that we’re able to cover everyone who is in fact able to be covered. It, put your hand down for a second Bernie. Okay.",Dec
Bernie Sanders,Just Waving to you Joe.,Dec
Joe Biden,"I know. So look, it covers everybody. It’s realistic and most importantly, it lets you choose what you want. Here you have 160 million people have negotiated their healthcare plans with their employer. Like many of you had. You may or may not like it. If you don’t like it, you can move into the public option that I proposed in my plan. But if you like it, you shouldn’t have Washington dictating you. You can not keep the plan you have. That’s a fun…",Dec
Tim,"Thank you. Vice president Biden.  Senator Sanders, 45 seconds to respond.",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"Under Joe’s plan essentially, we retain the status quo.",Dec
Joe Biden,That’s not true.,Dec
Bernie Sanders,"That is exactly true. Thank you. And by the way, Joe, under your plan, you asked me how are we going to pay for it? Under your plan I’ll tell you how we’re paying for right now. The average worker in America, their family makes 60,000 a year. That family is now paying $12,000 a year for health care. 20% of the income or the Medicare for all that family will be paying $1,200 a year because we’re eliminating the profiteering of the drug companies and the insurance companies and ending, there’s Byzantine and complex administration of thousands of separate healthcare plans.",Dec
Tim,45 seconds for Vice President Biden.,Dec
Joe Biden,"I’m the only guy that’s not interrupted here. All right, I’m going to interrupt now. It costs 30 trillion dollars. Let’s get that straight. $30 trillion over 10 years. Some say it costs 20 trillion. Some say it cost 40. The idea that you’re going to be able to save that person making $60,000 a year on Medicare for all is absolutely preposterous. 16% of the American public is on Medicare now and everybody has a tax taken out of their paycheck now. Tell me, you’re going to add 84% more and it’s not going to be higher taxes, at least before he was honest about it. It’s going to increase personal taxes. They’re going to be…",Dec
Bernie Sanders,"That’s right. We all got to increase personal taxes, but we’re eliminating premiums, we’re eliminating copayments, we’re eliminating deductibles, we’re eliminating all out of pocket expenses and no family in America will spend more than $200 a year on prescription drugs.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,Hey…,Dec
Bernie Sanders,It’s first time I did this.,Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"Okay, that’s true. I’ll say this. First of all, Bernie, I promise when I am your president, I will get our pharmaceutical bills done and we have worked together on this time and time again and I agree with you on that. But where I disagree is, I just don’t think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas. I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time. That is why I favor a public option, which is a nonprofit option to bring the cost down and yes, it does bring the cost down immediately for 13 million people and then we’ll expand coverage to 12 million people.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"But here’s the political problem. This fight that you guys are having isn’t real. Your fight, Bernie is not with me or with Vice President Biden. It is with all those, bunch of those new house members. Not everyone by any means, that got elected in that last election in the democratic party. It is with the new governor, democratic governor of Kentucky that wants to build on Obamacare. And the way I look at it, if you want to cross a river over some trouble waters, you build a bridge, you don’t blow one up. And I think we should build on the affordable care act.",Dec
Bernie Sanders,She took my name in vain. She hurt my feelings.,Dec
Tim,45 seconds Senator Sanders.,Dec
Bernie Sanders,"All right. My fight, Amy, it’s not with the governor of Kentucky. My fight and all of our fights must be with the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry. With the greed and corruption of the insurance industry. These guys last year made $100 billion in profit and tens of millions of Americans cannot afford to go to a doctor tonight. The day has got to come and Joe is not talking about it. Amy is not talking about it. The day has got to come and I will bring that day about what we finally say that the drug companies and the insurance companies, the function of health care is that provided for all of our people in a cost effective way, not to make massive profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies.",Dec
Tim,"We’d like to bring you into this discussion. The same question to you that I posed to Senator Sanders. If Congress rejects a Medicare for all proposal and you’re the president, are there smaller specific measures that you could pursue with bipartisan support to decrease costs and expand coverage?",Dec
E. Warren,"So this is about costs. It’s about costs on middle class families. Last year, 36 million Americans didn’t have a prescription filled because they couldn’t afford it. And those are people with health insurance as well. People who can’t do the copays, people who can’t do the deductibles. People who find out that the drug is not covered. So here’s how I approach this. I want to do the most good I can for the most people as quickly as possible. On day one, I’m going to attack the prices on commonly used drugs like Epipens and insulin and bring down those prices.",Dec
E. Warren,"The president can do that. I love saying this all by herself and I will do it. That’s going to save families hundreds of millions of dollars and then in the first hundred days, because I found a way to pay for full healthcare coverage for everyone, without raising taxes on middle class families. I’m going to make available to people for a full healthcare coverage for 135 million people. It’ll be at no cost at all and they can opt into that system. For others. It will be at a low cost. We have got to start moving and move fast  and do that. We can do that on 50 votes.",Dec
Tim,Thank you Senator. Judy?,Dec
Judy,"We are coming to the end of our time. A lot of hands up. We apologize for that, but in the spirit of the season, I’d like to ask each one of you, is there someone else among these candidates that you would have, you have two options. One, a candidate from whom you would ask forgiveness for something, maybe that was said tonight or another time. Or a candidate to whom you would like to give a gift and I’m going to start with you, Mr. Yang.",Dec
Andrew Yang,Wow.,Dec
E. Warren,We can do a labor action and just all go on strike on this one Andrew.,Dec
Tim,"I don’t think I have much to ask forgiveness for or you all can correct me on this. In terms of a gift, Elizabeth has done me the honor of starting to read my book. I would love to give each of you a copy of my book. It’s about how we’re going through the greatest economic transformation in our country’s history, the fourth industrial revolution. It is grinding up our communities and D.C. Is out to lunch on this. Our media organizations are not covering it adequately. I wrote a book on it and if you like data, this book is for you. This goes for the people at home too. If you like data and books.",Dec
Judy,"Mayor Buttigieg, ask forgiveness or give a gift?",Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, first of all, I love data and books, so I think we should all be excited about this. And come to think of it, I should probably send my book around more to. Look. I think all of us want the same thing at the end of the day. We know what a gift it would be to the future and to the country for literally anybody up here to become president of The United States compared to what we’ve got. And we got to remember there. I don’t know how many, now we’re up to 25 something, have run for president in the democratic party. The moment we’ve got a nominee, the 24 who aren’t that nominee are going to have to rally around the one who does. Let’s make sure there’s not too much to ask for forgiveness for by the time that day comes.",Dec
Judy,Senator Warren?,Dec
E. Warren,"I will ask for forgiveness. I know that sometimes I get really worked up and sometimes I get a little hot. I don’t really mean to. What happens is when you do 100,000 selfies with people you hear enough stories about people who are really down to their last moments. I met someone just last week in Nevada, who said that he has diabetes and that he has access to a prescription because he’s a veteran. But his sister has diabetes, his daughter has diabetes, and they simply can’t afford insulin. So the three of them spend all of their time figuring out how to stretch one insulin prescription among three people. When I think about what we could do if we get a majority in the house, a majority in the Senate, and get back the white house, we could make this country work for people like that man. And that’s why I’m in this fight.",Dec
Judy,Vice President Biden?,Dec
E. Warren,"I think everyone up here on this stage, and those are not on the stage who’ve run, we owe them because they’re all pushing for the same exact thing. You’re not the only one that does Senator. I’ve done thousands of them. And the crew that follows me can tell you there’s not one line I go through. I don’t have at least to have a dozen people come up and hug me and say, can you help me? I just lost my daughter 10 days ago. Can you help me? Tell me am I going to be okay? Can you help me? I just lost  and they’d go and lay out their problems. My wife and I have a call list of somewhere between 20 and a hundred people that we call at least every week or every month to tell them I’m here.",Dec
E. Warren,"I give them my private phone number. They keep in touch with me. A little kid who says, (stuttering) I can’t talk. What do I do? I have scores of these young women and men who I keep in contact with. And the reason I would give everyone here at gift is because they want to do something like I do, of making their lives better because there’s a lot of people who are hurting very, very, very badly.",Dec
Judy,Senator Sanders? Forgiveness or a gift?,Dec
Bernie Sanders,"Well, I can give out any one of four books that I wrote. But I think the gift that all of us need to give to the American people is a very different vision of the reality of the Trump administration. And the vision that we need to bring forth, is to create a government and a nation based on love and compassion, not greed and hatred. We need a vision which says that in our great country, all of our people should be able to earn a decent standard of living, have health care, have the ability to send their kids to college regardless of their income. So we need a new vision, which brings our people together. Around an agenda that works for all, not the Trump vision of dividing us up to benefit the billionaire class. That’s my vision.",Dec
Judy,Senator Klobuchar.?,Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"Well, I’d ask for forgiveness anytime any of you get mad at me. I can be blunt, but I am doing this because I think it is so important to pick the right candidate here. I do. I think when you see what’s going on around the country, yes, it’s the economic check that Elizabeth and Bernie have so well pointed out on this stage, but there’s something else going on here and it is a decency check. It is a values check. It is a patriotism check. When you see people, and we’ve all had this happen, that come to our meetings and say yeah, I voted for Donald Trump but I don’t want to do it again because I want my kids to be able to watch the president on TV and not mute the TV. We have to remember as Democrats, and if I get worked up about this, it’s because I believe it’s so much in my heart, that we have to bring people with us and not shut them out. That is the gift we can give America in this election.",Dec
Judy,Mr Steyer?,Dec
Tom Steyer,"So, look, this is the holiday season and what I’m hearing from every single one of these candidates is that they’ve gone around the United States and what they’ve seen from this administration and what they’ve seen from the Republican party is cruelty towards the people of the United States for money. So when I think about the gift that I’d like to give, and I’ve seen that too. I mean I think it starts with cruelty. When children are born and it goes right through life into pre-K, education, health care, a living wage, there is cruelty to working people, there’s cruelty to seniors.",Dec
Tom Steyer,"And so the gift that I’d like to give everyone on this stage, which was the original question, is the gift of teamwork. Because the question up here is, how are we together going to change this framework? How are we together, going to beat this corrupt and criminal president? How are we going to stand up for the people of the United States together? Not by tearing each other down, but by supporting each other and by realizing that what we stand for is the true value of America. And as a team that’s how we’re going to do it. And as Americans, we’re going to come together to stand up for the original values, freedom, equality, justice, teamwork.",Dec
Judy,We are going to take a very short break. That does conclude our questions tonight here at Loyola Marymount university. We’ll be back in just two minutes to hear the candidates closing statements.,Dec
Judy Woodruff,Welcome back to the PBS news hour Democratic debate with Politico and now it’s time for closing statements.,Dec
Judy Woodruff,Each have 60 seconds beginning with Mr. Steyer.,Dec
Tom Steyer,"I’m different from everybody else on this stage and here’s why, I’m running because corporations have bought our government and we need to return power to the people. And for the last 10 years, that’s exactly what I’ve been doing, taking on unchecked corporate power. That’s why I’m for term limits, because if we’re going to have bold change, then we need new people in charge and new ideas. I’m the only person on this stage who’s built a large, multi billion dollar international business. I know how to grow prosperity. I can take on Mr. Trump on the economy and beat him. I’m the only one on this stage who said climate is my number one priority. It’s a crisis we have to deal with, but it’s also our greatest opportunity to create millions of good paying union jobs across the country and clean up the air and water and the black and brown communities where it’s so essential. So if you want to break the corporate stranglehold, beat Mr. Trump on the economy and solve our climate crisis. I can deliver-",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Mr. Yang.,Dec
Tom Steyer,and I’m asking for your vote.,Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Sorry, my apology for interrupting. Mr. Yang.",Dec
Andrew Yang,"I know what you’re thinking. America, how am I still on this stage with them?",Dec
Andrew Yang,"Our campaign is growing all the time because we are laser focused on solving the real problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. I spent seven years helping create thousands of jobs in Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans and other cities, serving as an ambassador of entrepreneurship under President Obama, and I saw firsthand what many of you already know, our country is falling apart. Our senior citizens are working until the day they die. Our kids are addicted to smartphones or drugs. We’re seeing record high levels of depression, suicides, overdoses. Our companies are recording record profits while our people are literally dying younger. Our way of life is changing faster than ever. And the simple fact is this, our politicians in D C succeed whether we the people succeed or fail. Washington DC today is the richest city in our country. What do they produce? Bad decisions? We need to get the money out of DC and into your hands, the hands of the American people. Join us in Yang2020.com and help us rewrite the rules of the 20th century economy to work for us.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Thank you, Senator  Senator Klobuchar",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"We have had quite a debate tonight, but I want to debate Donald Trump. This primary comes down to some simple questions. Who has the best ideas, the best experience, mostly, who can beat Donald Trump and how will she do it? So Donald Trump built his fortune on over time, over $413 million that he got from his Dad. My Grandpa, he was an iron ore miner, a union member who worked 1500 feet underground, and he saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my Dad to a community college. That’s my family trust.",Dec
Amy Klobuchar,"And I figure if you are given opportunity, you don’t go into the world with a sense of entitlement. You go into it with a sense of obligation. An obligation to lift people up instead of hoarding what you have for yourself. Our politics right now because of Donald Trump are toxic. We need a leader who can bring people together and who can win that way. So if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me. If you want a bigger tent and a wider coalition and longer coattails, join me. We will win at amyklobuchar.com",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Thank you.  Mayor Buttigieg,Dec
Pete Buttigieg,"So the nominee is going to have to do two things, defeat Donald Trump, and unite the country as president. It’s a tall order. And in order to do it, we’re going to need a nominee and a president who can respond to the crisis of belonging that is gripping our nation today. That means building up a politics that is defined, not by who we exclude, not by who we reject, but by how many people we can call to this side. I have seen so many people capable of forming that multiracial, multi generational coalition and I’m seeing more and more people who maybe have not felt welcome in the Democratic party before, but belong here now, because they’re definitely not on board with what’s going on in the Trump white house. I am asking you to join me, to vote for me to caucus for me and to help us build that future defined not by exclusion but by belonging.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Senator Warren,Dec
E. Warren,"Did you call my name? This is a dark moment in America and yet I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope. All three of my brothers served in the military. They’re all retired. They’re all back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat, two are Republicans. But you know what unites my three brothers Amazon, they are furious that Amazon reported $10 billion in profits and paid zero in taxes. My brothers are part of why is ready to root out corruption and fight back, and that gives us a base to work from. America is ready for 2 cent wealth tax. It’s supported by Republicans, Democrats and Independents, and it lets us invest in all of our children.",Dec
E. Warren,"America is ready to expand social security payments and disability payments by $200 a month and we can do it. You know, someone asks what this would mean, you just give somebody $200 a month. They asked me this in a town hall, and a lady who wanted it said, “you know what it will mean to me. It’ll mean I can get a prescription filled, and I can still buy toilet paper this same week.” That’s where Americans are right now. I am not working for millionaires and billionaires. I’m here to work for the tens of millions of people across this country who are ready to build an America that won’t just work those at the top, but that will work for everyone.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Thank you. Senator Sanders,Dec
Bernie Sanders,"45 years, Americans have been listening to great speeches, and at the end of the day, the average American worker is not making a nickel more than he or she did in real wages, over those 45 years. The truth is that real change always takes place. Real change always takes place from the bottom on up, never from the top on down. And that is why in this campaign, I am so proud that we have over a million volunteers. We have some of the strongest grassroots organizations. We have raised more individual contributions than any candidate in American history. Please join the political revolution @berniesanders.com. Let’s defeat Trump. Let’s transform this country. Thank you.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,And finally Vice President Biden.,Dec
Joe Biden,"Thank you very much for listening, seven days out, Christmas. Thank you very much. Look, we all have big progressive plans and the question is, who can deliver on those plans? And it seems to me we have to ask ourselves three questions straight up and honestly. Who has the best chance, most likely chance of defeating Donald Trump? Who is the one who’s most likely to do that? Number two, who can help elect Democrats to the United States Senate, in States like North Carolina and Georgia and Arizona and other States.",Dec
Joe Biden,"And thirdly, who can deliver legislatively? That requires you to look at our records. I have a significant record of getting significant things done from the Violence Against Women Act and the Chemical Weapons Treaty in foreign and domestic policy alike. And so I think asking those questions, I believe, as you expect, that I’m the most qualified to answer those three questions. But most of all, we’ve got to level with the American people. Don’t play games with them, tell them the truth and be authentic. God bless you all and may you all have a great, great holiday season and thank you guys for doing this as well.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Thank you.,Dec
Judy Woodruff,"Thank you very much. And that concludes the PBS news hour Politico debate. I do want to thank my colleagues here at the moderator table, Tim Alberta of Politico, Amna Nawaz and Yamiche Alcindor of the PBS news hour.",Dec
Judy Woodruff,Thank you all for joining us. Please stick around and watch PBS for some analysis. Thank you to the candidates.,Dec
Wolf Blitzer,00),Jan
Bernie Sanders,"When the Congress was debating whether or not we go into a war in Iraq, invade Iraq, I got up on the floor of the House and I said that would be a disaster, it would lead to unprecedented levels of chaos in the region. And I’d not only voted against the wall, I help lead the effort against that wall. Just last year, I helped for the first time in the modern history of this country, pass a War Powers Act Resolution, working with a conservative Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, which said that the war in Yemen, led by Saudi Arabia was unconstitutional because Congress had not authorized it.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"We got a majority vote in the Senate. We got a majority vote in the House. Unfortunately, Bush vetoed that and that horrific war continues. I am able to work with Republicans. I am able to bring people together, to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table, not through military efforts.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Vice President Biden, you talk a lot about your experience, but some of your competitors have taken issue with that experience, questioning your judgment in voting to authorize the Iraq war. Why are you the best prepared person in this stage to be Commander in Chief?",Jan
Joe Biden,"I said 13 years ago, it was a mistake to give the President the authority to go to war, if in fact he couldn’t get inspectors into Iraq to stop what thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon. It was a mistake and I acknowledged that. But the man who also argued against that war, Barack Obama picked me to be his Vice President and once we were elected President, and Vice President, he turned to me and asked me to end that war. I know what it’s like to send a son or daughter and like our colleague has gone to war in Afghanistan, my son for a year in Iraq and that’s why I do it very, very reluctantly.",Jan
Joe Biden,"That’s why I led the effort as you know, Wolf against surging tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan. We should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interest of United States are at stake. They were not at stake there. They were not at stake in Iraq and it was a mistaken vote. But I think my record overall on every other thing we’ve done has been… I’m prepared to compare it to anybody’s on this stage.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Senator Sanders, you have been attacking Vice President Biden’s vote on the Iraq war, but you recently acknowledged that your vote to authorize the war in Afghanistan was also a mistake. So you’ve both acknowledged mistakes. Why should the American people trust your judgment more?",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Well, it’s a little bit of a difference on that particular vote, every single member of the House, including myself voted for it, only Barbara Lee voted against it. But what I understood from right away in terms of the war in Iraq, the difference here is that the war in Iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country. As Joe well knows, we lost 4,500 brave troops, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"We have spent trillions of dollars on that endless war, money which should go into healthcare and education and infrastructure in this country. Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and Rumsfeld had to say. I thought they were lying. I didn’t believe them for a moment, I took to the floor I did everything I could to prevent that war. Joe saw it differently.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,Vice President Biden.,Jan
Joe Biden,"I was asked to bring 156,000 troops home from that war, which I did. I led that effort. It was a mistake to trust that they weren’t going to go to war. They said they were not going to go to war. They said they were just going to get inspectors in. The world, in fact voted to send inspectors in and they still went to war. From that point on, I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake and from that point on, I moved to bring those troops home.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Senator Klobuchar, you’ve publicly questioned Mayor Buttigieg’s experience when it comes to being Commander in Chief. Why is your time as a US Senator more valuable than his time as a US Naval intelligence officer in Afghanistan and as mayor?",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"Thank you Wolf, and I’ve been very clear that I respect the mayor’s experience very much in the military. I just have different experience. I’ve been in the US Senate for over 12 years and I think what you want in a President is someone who has dealt with these life and death issues and who has made decisions. I will look at my position on the Iraq war first. I wasn’t in the Senate for that vote, but I opposed that war from the very beginning. In my first campaign for Senate, I ran against a Republican who ran ads against me on it, but I stood my ground. When I got to the Senate, I pushed to bring our troops home.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"Then I have dealt with every issue from Afghanistan, to keeping our troops with good healthcare, after what we saw with Walter Reed and being part of an effort to improve the situation for our troops in a very big way with their education and with their jobs and also with their healthcare. I think right now what we should be talking about though, Wolfe, is what is happening right now with Donald Trump. Donald Trump is taking us pell-mell toward another war. We have a very important resolution.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"We just found out today the four Republicans are joining Democrats to go to him and say, “You must have an authorization of military force if you’re going to go to war with Iran.” That is so important because we have a situation where he got us out of the Iranian nuclear agreement, something I on for a significant period of time. As President, I will get us back into that agreement. I will take an oath to protect and defend our constitution and I will mean it.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. We are going to continue talking about who’s best prepared to be Commander in Chief Mayor Buttigieg.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, I bring a different perspective. There are enlisted people that I served with, barely old enough to remember those votes on the authorization after 9-11, on the war in Iraq, and there are people now old enough to enlist who were not alive for some of those debates. The next President is going to be confronted with national security challenges, different in scope and in kind from anything we’ve seen before.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"Not just conventional military challenges, not just stateless terrorism, but cybersecurity challenges, climate security challenges, foreign interference in our elections. It’s going to take a view to the future, as well as the readiness, to learn from the lessons of the past and for me, those lessons of the past are personal.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Senator Warren and our new CNN Des Moines Register poll, almost a third of your supporters say your ability to lead the military is more of a weakness than a strength of yours. Why are you best prepared to be Commander in Chief?",Jan
E. Warren,"I believe the principal job of the Commander in Chief is to keep America safe and I think that’s about judgment. I think it starts with knowing our military. I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I work with our generals, with our military leaders, with our intelligence, but I also visit our troops. I visit our troops around the world. I’ve been to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to Jordan, to South Korea. I’ve been to lots of places to talk with our troops. And I fight for our troops to make sure that they get their pay, that they get the housing and medical benefits that they’ve been promised, that they don’t get cheated by giant financial institutions.",Jan
E. Warren,"I have three brothers who are in the military and I know how much our military families sacrifice, but I also know that we have to think about our defense in very different ways. We have to think about cyber. We have to think about climate. We also have to think about how we spend money. We have a problem with a revolving door in Washington, between the defense industry and the Department of Defense and the Pentagon. That is corruption, pure and simple. We need to block that revolving door and we need to cut our defense budget. We need to depend on all of our tools, diplomatic, economic, working with our allies and not let the defense industry call the shots.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Mr. Steyer, you worked in finance for decades and have never held elected office. Why should voters believe you have the experience or judgment to serve as Commander in Chief?",Jan
Tom Steyer,"I worked internationally around the world for decades. I traveled, I met with governments, I met with business, and I understand how America interacts with other countries. And you asked what is the reason that the experience really counts? And to me, I believe that Senator Warren made a great point. It isn’t so much about experience, it’s about judgment. If you’ve been listening to this, what we are hearing is 20 years of mistakes by the American government in the Middle East, of failure, of mistakes. So the real question is judgment.",Jan
Tom Steyer,"And if you look who had the judgment, it was a State Senator from Illinois with no experience named Barack Obama who opposed the war. It is a Congress woman, Barbara Lee from Oakland, California, who stood up against the original vote, who was the only person in Congress. So I would say to you this, an outside perspective looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what we’re looking for now. I agree with Senator Warren, we are spending dramatically too much money on defense. The money that we’re spending there, we could spend in the other parts of the budget and it’s time for someone from the outside to have a strategic view about what we’re trying to do and how to do it.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Senator Sanders, in the wake of the Iran crisis, Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei has again called for all US troops to be pulled out of the Middle East, something you’ve called for as well. Yet when American troops last left Iraq, ISIS emerged and spread terror across the Middle East and indeed around the world. How would you prevent that from happening again?",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Okay, let me tell you, but before I tell you that, let me tell you something else. And that is, and I don’t know if my colleagues here will agree with me or not, maybe they will. But what we have to face as a nation is that the two great foreign policy disasters of our lifetimes are the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq, both of those wars were based on lies. And right now what I fear very much is we have a President who is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in Iraq.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"To answer your question, what we need to do is have an international coalition. We cannot keep acting unilaterally. As you know, the nuclear deal with Iran was worked on with a number of our allies. We have got to undo what Trump did, bring that coalition together and make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,Vice President Biden.,Jan
Joe Biden,"I was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with Iran, bringing together the rest of the world and including some of the folks who aren’t friendly to us and it was working. It was working, it was being held tightly. There was no movement on the part of the Iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon. And look what’s happened, he went ahead and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement, Trump, what exactly would happened. We’re now isolated. We’re in a situation where our allies in Europe are making a comparison between the United States and Iran, saying both ought to stand down, making a moral equivalence. We have lost our standing in the region, we have lost the support of our allies. The next President has to be able to pull those folks back together, re-establish our alliances and insist that Iran go back into the agreement, which I believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"So just to be clear, Vice President Biden, would you leave troops in the Middle East or would you pull them out?",Jan
Joe Biden,"I would leave troops in the Middle East in terms of patrolling the Gulf, where we are now, small numbers of troops. And I think it’s a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with ISIS. What’s happened is, now that he’s gone ahead, the President and started this whole process moving, what’s happening? ISIS is going to reconstitute itself. We’re in a position where we have to pull our forces out. Americans have to leave the entire region and quite frank, I think he’s flat out lied about saying the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Senator Klobuchar, what’s your response?",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"I would leave some troops there, but not in the level that Donald Trump is taking us right now. Afghanistan, I have long wanted to bring our troops home, I would do that. Some would remain for counter terrorism and training. In Syria, I would not have removed 150 troops from the border with Turkey. I think that was a mistake. I think it made our allies and many others much more vulnerable to ISIS. And then when it comes to Iraq, right now I would leave our troops there despite the mess that has been created by Donald Trump.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"At the briefing we had last week, I was the only person on this stage that asked a question of both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State. And I asked them about imminent threat, but I also ask them what their alternatives were and they gave very vague, vague answers. I asked them where is the surge of diplomacy that we would be seeing if I was President? And I asked them where they were going to leave the Iraqi people? Time and time again, you see that this President puts his own interest, his private interests in front of our countries. I would put our country’s interests first as Commander in Chief.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"So Senator Warren, leave combat troops, at least some combat troops in the Middle East or bring them home?",Jan
E. Warren,"No, I think we need to get our combat troops out. You know, we have to stop this mindset that we can do everything with combat troops. Our military is the finest military on earth and they will take any sacrifice we ask them to take, but we should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. Our keeping combat troops there is not helping. We need to work with our allies. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools.",Jan
E. Warren,"Now look, I understand there are people on this stage when it comes to Afghanistan, for example, who talk about five more years, 10 more years. Shoot Lindsay Graham talks about leaving troops there for a hundred more years. No one has a solution and an end point. We need to get our combat troops out. They are not helping create more safety for the United States or the region.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,Vice President Biden is Senator Warren right?,Jan
Joe Biden,"Well, I’ll tell you what. There’s a difference between combat troops and leaving special forces in a position. I was part of the coalition that put together 68 countries to deal with stateless terror, as well as failed States, not us alone, 68 other countries. That’s how we were able to defeat and end the caliphate for ISIS. They’ll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organize the effort to take them down.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Mayor Buttigieg, you served in Afghanistan, who’s right?",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"If we can continue to remain engaged without having an endless commitment of ground troops. But what’s going on right now is the President’s actually sending more. The very President who said he was going to end endless war, who pretended to have been against the war in Iraq all along. But we know that’s not true. Now has more troops going into the Middle East. And whenever I see that happen, I think about the day we shipped out and the time that was set aside for saying goodbye to family members.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"I remember walking with a friend of mine, another Lieutenant I trained with as we walked away and his one and a half year old boy was toddling after him not understanding why his father wasn’t turning back to scoop him up. And it took all the strength he had, not to turn around and look at his boy one more time. That is happening by the thousands right now, as we see so many more troops sent into harm’s way. And my perspective is to ensure that that will never happen when there is an alternative as Commander in Chief.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,Senator Sanders.,Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Wolf, in America today, our infrastructure is crumbling. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. 87 million people have no healthcare or are under insured. You got 500,000 people sleeping out on the streets tonight. The American people are sick and tired of endless wars, which have cost us trillions of dollars. Our job is to rebuild the United Nations, rebuild the State department, make sure that we have the capability of bringing the world together to resolve international conflict diplomatically and stop the endless wars that we have experienced.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"We’re going to get to everyone, but Vice President Biden. You criticized President Trump’s decision to kill the Iranian General Soleimani, without first going to Congress. Are there any circumstances other than a direct attack on the United States where you would take military action without congressional approval?",Jan
Joe Biden,"I ran the first time as a 29 year old kid against the war in Vietnam, on the grounds that only way they can take a nation to war, is with the informed consent of the American people. The informed consent of the American people. And with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere, excluding special forces, there’s no way you negotiate or been able to negotiate with terrorists. You have to be able to form coalitions, to be able to defeat them or contain them.",Jan
Joe Biden,"If you don’t, we end up being the world’s policeman again. They’re going to come to us, they’ve come to us before, they’ll come to us again. So that’s a fundamental difference than negotiating with other countries, it’s fundamentally a requirement that we use our special forces in small numbers to coordinate with other countries to bring together coalitions.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Mr Vice President, just to be clear, the Obama-Biden administration did not ask Congress for permission multiple times when it took military action. So wouldn’t the Biden doctrine be different?",Jan
Joe Biden,"No, there was the authorization for the use of military force that was passed by the United States Congress House and Senate and signed by the President. That was the authority, does not give authority to go into Iran, it gave authority to deal with these other issues.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,Mayor Buttigieg.,Jan
Pete Buttigieg,That authorization needs to be replaced.,Jan
Joe Biden,Exactly. We tried that.,Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"When we lost troops in , there were members of Congress who admitted they didn’t even know we had troops there. And it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with Al Qaeda and 9-11. And often Congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role. Now thanks to Democrats in Congress, that’s changing. But the reality is year after year, Congress didn’t want to touch this either because it was so politically difficult. Fundamental truth is, if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harm’s way, often on deployment after deployment, then we’ve got to make sure that Congress has the courage to take tough up or down votes on whether they ought to be there. And when I am President, anytime, which I hope will never happen, but anytime I’m compelled to use force, I seek that authorization. We will have a three year sunset, so that the American people are included not only in the decision about whether to send troops but whether to continue.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Thank you. We’re going to get to everyone, but Senator Warren, what about you? Are there any circumstances other than a direct attack on the United States where you would take military action without congressional approval?",Jan
E. Warren,"Well imminent threat, but we need an authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat. That is what the constitution provides and that’s what as Commander in Chief, I will do. But I just want to be clear, everyone on this stage talks about nobody wants endless war, but the question is when and how do you plan to get out of it? On Senate Armed Services Committee, we have one general after another in Afghanistan who comes in and says, “You know, we’ve just turned the corner and now it’s all going to be different.”",Jan
E. Warren,"And then what happens? It’s all the same for another year. Someone new comes in and we’ve just turned the corner. We’ve turned the corners so many times we’re going in circles in these regions. This has got to stop. It’s not enough to say, “Someday we’re going to get out.” No one on the ground. None of our military can describe what the conditions are for getting out. It’s time to get our combat troops home.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Mr. Steyer, would a President’s Steyer use military force as a deterrent? And if not, under what circumstances would you take military action?",Jan
Tom Steyer,"I would take military action to protect the lives and safety of American citizens. But what we can see in the Middle East and what this conversation shows, is that there is no real strategy that we’re trying to accomplish in what we’re doing in the Middle East. Obviously Mr. Trump has no strategy. He is going from crisis to crisis from escalation to escalation. But if you look further over the last 20 years including in the war in Afghanistan, we know from the Washington Post that in fact there was no strategy, there was just a series of tactical decisions that made no sense.",Jan
Tom Steyer,"So we really have to ask ourselves in the Middle East, what are we trying to accomplish? I agree with Vice President Biden, to do it we should definitely be doing it in coalition with other countries. And I want to point out that as we do that we’re confronted by this issue which everyone is talking about. But at the same time there’s a gigantic climate issue in Australia, which also requires the same kind of value driven coalition building, that we actually should be using in the Middle East. We need to ask ourselves, how are we going to provide a world that is safer for Americans, where we can prosper more? And every single thing we do should follow into that strategy and it’s just not happening in Washington DC.",Jan
Abby Phillip,"Mayor Buttigieg, another critical issue you’d face as President is the threat of nuclear weapons. Last week, President Trump said, “As long as I am President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.” Would a President Buttigieg make that same promise?",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"Ensuring that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons, will of course be a priority because it’s such an important part of keeping America safe. But unfortunately, President Trump has made it much harder for the next President to achieve that goal. By gutting the Iran nuclear deal, one that by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran. By gutting that they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we’re now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war. Now-  Yes?",Jan
Abby Phillip,Continue.,Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"In order to get that done, we’ve got to work with our partners. The Iran nuclear deal, the technical term for it was the JCPOA, that first letter J stood for joint. We can’t do this alone. Even less so now after everything that has happened, which is why it will be so critically important to engage leaders, including a lot of new leaders emerging around the world and ensure that we have the alliances we need to meet what I believe is not just an American goal, but a widely shared goal around the world, to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear armed country.",Jan
Abby Phillip,"Mayor Buttigieg to be clear, would you allow Iran to become a nuclear power? Yes or no?",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"No. Our security depends on ensuring that Iran does not become nuclear. And by the way, we’ve got a lot other challenges with nuclear proliferation around the world. Despite this President’s coziness with Vladimir Putin, we actually seem to be further away from being able to work with Russia on things like the renewal of START. We’ve got to move toward less, not more nuclear danger, whether it is from States, from stateless potential terrorist actors or anywhere else around the world.",Jan
Abby Phillip,"Thank you Mayor Buttigieg. Senator Klobuchar, if you become President, it’s very possible there won’t be an Iran nuclear deal for the United States to rejoin. Given that, how would you prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon?",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"I would start negotiations again and I won’t take that as a given, given that our European partners are still trying to hold the agreement together. My issue is that because of the actions of Donald Trump, we are in a situation where they are now starting, Iran is starting to enrich uranium again, in violation of the original agreement. So what I would do is negotiate, I would bring people together just as President Obama did years ago, and I think that we can get this done. But you have to have a President that sees this as a number one goal. And an answer to the original question you asked the mayor, I would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. And then you have to get an agreement in place.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"I think there are changes you can make to the agreement, better sunsets and changes to the inspections, but overall that is what we should do. And I am the one person on this debate stage, on the first night of the very first debate, when we were asked what we saw as the biggest threat to our world, I said China on the economy, but I said Iran because of Donald Trump. Because I feared that exactly what happened would happen, enrichment of uranium, escalation of tensions, leaving frayed relations with our allies. We can bring them back, understanding this is a terrorist regime that we cannot allow to have a nuclear weapon.",Jan
Abby Phillip,"Vice President Biden, I want to ask you about North Korea. President Trump has met with Kim Jong-un three times. President Obama once said he would meet with North Korea without any preconditions. Would you meet with North Korea without any preconditions?",Jan
Joe Biden,"No, not now. I wouldn’t meet with him without any preconditions. Look, we gave him everything he’s looking for. Legitimacy, the President showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against them. I would be putting what I did as Vice President. I’ve met with Xi Jinping more than anyone else. I would be putting pressure on China to put pressure on Korea, to cease and desist from their nuclear power, make their efforts to deal with nuclear weapons. I would move forward as we did before and you reported it extensively Wolf, about moving forward the whole notion of defense against nuclear weapons.",Jan
Joe Biden,"And when China said to me, when Xi Jinping said to me, “That’s a threat to us.” I said, “We’re going to move and protect our interests unless you get involved and protect it.” I would re-ignite the relationship between Japan and South Korea and I would put enormous pressure on China because it’s also in their interest for them to put pressure on North Korea to cease and desist. But I would not meet with absent preconditions. I would not meet with the “Supreme leader” who said, “Joe Biden is a rabid dog. He should be beaten to death with a stick.” I count that.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Other than that, you like him.",Jan
Joe Biden,Other than that I like him and he got a love letter from Trump right after that.,Jan
Abby Phillip,"Mr. Steyer, would you meet with North Korea without any preconditions?",Jan
Tom Steyer,"No. It’s very clear that if we’re going to do something with North Korea, we’re going to have to do it in concert with our allies. That meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere, that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get. But this is a classic situation where the United States idea of going it alone makes no sense. And when you are talking about Iran, let’s face it, Iran is under great pressure economically. So every single discussion we’ve had about Iran has had to do with military power and America versus Iran. Whereas in fact what worked with President Obama was an Alliance of our allies and us, putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic. That to me is called strategy, having a goal to make America safer by looking more broadly than just us as the policemen of the world-",Jan
Abby Phillip,Thank you Mr. Steyer.,Jan
Tom Steyer,… Spending money.,Jan
B. Pfannenstiel,"Let’s stay with the theme of America’s role in the world and talk about trade. Tomorrow, President Trump is expected to sign phase one of a trade agreement with China and the Senate will likely soon approve a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, Iowa’s largest trading partners. Senator Sanders, you have said that new deal, the USMCA, ” Makes some modest improvements,” yet you’re going to vote against it. Aren’t modest improvements better than no improvements for the farmers and manufacturers who have been devastated here in Iowa?",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"The answer is we could do much better than a Trump led trade deal. This deal, and I think the proponents of it acknowledge, will result in the continuation of the loss of hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs, as a result of outsourcing. The heart and soul of our disaster trade agreements and I’m the guy who voted against NAFTA and against permanent normal trade relations with China, is that we have forced American workers to compete against people in Mexico, in China, elsewhere, who earn starvation wages, a dollar or $2 an hour.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Second of all, every major environmental organization has said no to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase climate change in it. And given the fact that climate change is right now the greatest threat facing this planet, I will not vote for a trade agreement that does not incorporate very, very strong principles to significantly lower fossil fuel emissions in the world.",Jan
B. Pfannenstiel,"But Senator Sanders, to be clear, the AFL-CIO supports this deal. Are you unwilling to compromise?",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"The AFL-CIO does, the machinists union does not. And every environmental organization in this country, including the sunrise organization who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it. So I happen to believe, and I hope we will talk about climate change in a moment. If we do not get our act together in terms of climate change, the planet that we’re going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren will be increasingly unlivable and uninhabitable.",Jan
B. Pfannenstiel,We’re going to get to climate change but I’d like to stay on trade. Senator Warren.,Jan
Bernie Sanders,Well they are the same in this issue.,Jan
B. Pfannenstiel,"Senator Warren, you support the USMCA, why is Senator Sanders wrong?",Jan
E. Warren,"I do. I wasn’t here, I haven’t been in Congress long enough to have voted against NAFTA, but I led the fight against the trade deal with Asia and the trade deal with Europe because I didn’t think it was in the interest of the American people, the American workers or environmental interests. But we have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting and they are hurting because of Donald Trump’s initiated trade wars. We have workers who are hurting because the agreements that have already been cut, really don’t have enforcement on workers rights.",Jan
E. Warren,"This new trade deal is a modest improvement, Senator Sanders himself has said so. It will give some relief to our farmers, it will give some relief to our workers. I believe we accept that relief, we try to help the people who need help and we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal. We need a coherent trade policy. We need a policy that actually helps our workers, our farmers. We need them at the table, not just a trade policy written for big international companies. I’m ready to have that fight but let’s help the people who need help right now.",Jan
B. Pfannenstiel,"Thank you. Senator Sanders, can you please respond to Senator Warren?",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Well, I think that it is not so easy to put together new trade legislation. If this is passed, I think it will set us back a number of years. Senator Warren is right, in saying we need to bring the stakeholders to the table, that is the family farmers here in Iowa and in Vermont and around the country. That is the environmental community, that…",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"In Vermont and around the country, that is the environmental community. That is the workers. Bottom line here is I am sick and tired of trade agreements negotiated by the CEOs of large corporations.",Jan
Moderator 1,"Senator Klobuchar, I’d like to bring you in here.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"Brianne, I want to hit reality here. I serve on the agriculture committee, and I will never forget going to Crawfordsville here in Iowa, and thank you for bringing up Iowa, Brianne, since that is where we are. I went to this plant, and there was one worker left in that plant. That plant had been shut down because of Donald Trump’s trade policies and because of what he had done to those workers, with giving secret waivers to oil companies and ruining the renewable fuel standard.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"That worker brought out a coat rack of uniforms, and he said, “These are my friends. They don’t work here anymore.” Their names were embroidered on those uniforms, Derek, Mark, Salvador, and that guy started to cry.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"These are real people hurt by Donald Trump’s trade war. So what we should do, and I support the USMCA. I am glad that these improvements were made that are supported by people like Richard Trumka and Sherrod Brown, on labor and environment, on pharma, the sweetheart deal, because I think we need a big trading block with North America to take on China. The way you are stronger than China is with your allies.",Jan
Moderator 1,"Senator Klobuchar, your time is up. Mayor Buttigieg, do you support the USMCA? Yes or no?",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"Yes, it has been improved. It is not perfect, but when you sit down with the people who are most impacted, they share just how much harm has been done to them by things like the trade war and just how much we can benefit, American consumers and workers and farmers, by making sure we have the right kind of labor and enforceability, as Democrats ensured we got in this USMCA.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"But let’s acknowledge why there is such fear and frustration. In my part of the country, in the industrial Midwest, I remember when they came around in the ’90s, selling trade deals, telling us, “Don’t worry about your slice of the pie. The pie will get so much bigger that everyone will be better off,” and that promise was broken. The part about the pie getting bigger happened. It’s just that the part about it getting to most people where I live did not.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"That is why there was such frustration. The sense that these decisions in board rooms and in committee rooms in Washington are being made not based on what’s best for us, but based on their own game.",Jan
Moderator 1,"Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders has said Donald Trump will, quote, eat your lunch for voting yes on what he calls terrible trade agreements. When it comes to trade, why are you the best candidate to take on President Trump?",Jan
Joe Biden,"There’ll be no trade agreements signed in my administration without environmentalist and labor at the table, and there will be no trade agreement until we invest more in American workers. We should be putting our money and our effort and our time in preparing America workers to compete in the 21st century on the high- tech side, dealing with artificial intelligence. We should be focusing on equipping American workers to do that.",Jan
Joe Biden,"By the way, the idea … I don’t know that there’s any trade agreement that the senator would ever think made any sense, but the problem is that 95% of the customers are out there. So we’ve got to figure out how we begin to write the rules of the road, not China.",Jan
Moderator 1,Senator Sanders?,Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Joe and I have a fundamental disagreement, in case you haven’t noticed, and that is NAFTA, PNTR with China, other trade agreements were written for one reason alone, and that is to increase the profits of large multinational corporations. The end result of those two, just PNTR with China, Joe, and NAFTA cost us some 4 million jobs as part of the race to the bottom.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"I am sick and tired and will not tolerate, and we will use the power of the federal contracting system. If a corporation in America wants to shut down in Iowa or Vermont or any place else and then they think they’re going to get online for a generous federal contract, they’ve got another thing going. We need some corporate responsibility here, and we need to protect good-paying jobs in America, not see them go to China, Mexico, Vietnam.",Jan
Moderator 1,"Mr. Vice President, what’s your response?",Jan
Joe Biden,"We need corporate responsibility, and I agree with that completely. But we also need to have enforcement mechanisms in the agreements we made, enforceable agreements. That’s one of the things that has been improved with the trade agreement with Mexico, and that’s what we should be doing in any agreement we have.",Jan
Joe Biden,"But let’s get back to the basics here. If we don’t set the rules of the road by going out to our partners, instead of poking our finger in the eye of all our friends and allies. We make up 25% of the world’s economy. We’ve got to bring the other 25% of our allies along with us to set the rules of the road so China cannot continue to abuse their power by stealing an actual are stealing our intellectual property and doing all the other things using their corporate state system to our significant disadvantage.",Jan
Moderator 1,Senator Warren?,Jan
E. Warren,"Our problem is not just that we need corporate responsibility. It’s been the structure of how these trade deals have been negotiated. The United States has had a strategy for decades, and that strategy has been to have government trade negotiators, a small number, and then surround them with giant multinational corporation lobbyists and corporate executives who whisper in the ears of our negotiators and then get deals cut that are great for the giant multinational corporations, not good for America, not good for American workers, not good for the environment.",Jan
E. Warren,"We need a different approach to trade, and it starts by calling out the corruption of these giant corporations that have cut our trade deals. Everybody wants to get to the American market, and we need to put some standards in place. You want to be able to sell your goods here, then you’ve got to meet some environmental standards. You’ve got to meet labor standards.",Jan
Moderator 1,"Thank you, Senator Warren.",Jan
E. Warren,We need a coherent approach.,Jan
Moderator 1,"I’d like to bring in Mr. Steyer here. Mr Steyer, even though farmers and manufacturers here in Iowa and around the country could see some relief from the China deal, they’ve been crushed by the current administration’s trade war. What will you do as President to help them get back on their feet?",Jan
Tom Steyer,"Look. On the first day, I would undo Mr. Trump’s tariffs. On the first day, I would get rid of his waivers that Senator Klobuchar was referring to, to oil refiners not having to use corn-based ethanol.",Jan
Tom Steyer,"In fact, these trade deals have been exactly what Senator Sanders and Warren have been saying, which is that they’ve been designed to grow the American GDP for the corporations of America, not for the working people of America, and not to protect the climate.",Jan
Tom Steyer,"So let me say this. I’m the only person on this stage who says climate is my number one priority. I would not sign this deal, because if climate is your number one priority, you can’t sign a deal, even if it’s marginally better for working people, until climate is also taken into consideration.",Jan
Tom Steyer,"Look. I’ve got four kids between the ages of 26 and 31. I cannot allow this country to go down the path of climate destruction. Everybody in their generation knows it. Frankly, Mayor Buttigieg, you’re their generation. I’d think you would be standing up more. Look. That’s why I’m standing up for it. We cannot put climate on the backseat all the time and say, “We’re going to sign this one more deal. We’re going to do one more thing without putting climate first.” That’s why it’s my number one priority. We can do it in a way that makes us richer, but we have to do it.",Jan
Moderator 1,"Mayor Buttigieg, your response?",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, that’s right. This issue’s personal for me. That’s why we’re going to tackle climate from day one. It’s why we’ve got to make sure that we have better answers than we do today.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"Now, what I’ve noticed is pretty much all of us propose that we move on from fossil fuels by the middle of the century, starting with actions that we take right now. The question is how are we going to make sure any of this actually gets done? Because people have been saying the right things in these debates for literally decades.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"The other day in Winterset, there was a kid at one of my events. Raised his hand, and he pointed out that he expects to be here in his nineties, in the year 2100. He will sit in judgment over what we do, not just what we on this stage do, anyone old enough to vote right now, whether we actually put together the national project it will require to meet our climate goals, to act aggressively, not just rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. That’s table stakes, but to actually move on from the fossil-dependent economy we live in today.",Jan
Moderator 2,"Let’s now turn to an issue that’s come up in the last 48 hours, Senator Sanders. Seen and reported yesterday that … Senator Sanders, Senator Warren confirmed in a statement that in 2018, you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election. Why did you say that?",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Well, as a matter of fact, I didn’t say it, and I don’t want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want. Anybody that knows me knows that it’s in comprehensible that I would think that a woman could not be President of the United States. Go to YouTube today. There’s a video of me 30 years ago, talking about how a woman could become President of the United States.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"In 2015, I deferred, in fact, to Senate Warren. There was a movement to draft Senator Warren to run for President, and you know what? I stayed back. Senator Warren decided not to run, and I did run afterwards.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by three million votes. How could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become President of the United States? Let me be very clear. If any of the women on this stage or any of the men on this stage win the nomination … I hope that’s not the case. I hope it’s me. But if they do, I will do everything in my power to make sure that they are elected in order to defeat the most dangerous President in the history of our country.",Jan
Moderator 2,"So Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, I do want to be clear here. You’re saying that you never told Senator Warren that a woman could not win the election?",Jan
Bernie Sanders,That is correct.,Jan
Moderator 2,"Senator Warren, what did you think when Senator Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?",Jan
E. Warren,"I disagreed. Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But look. This question about whether or not a woman can be President has been raised, and it’s time for us to attack it head-on. I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people’s winning record.",Jan
E. Warren,"So can a woman beat Donald Trump? Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost ten elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they’ve been in are the women. The only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican anytime in the past 30 years is me, and here’s what I know. The real danger that we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can’t pull our party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of the Democratic constituency.",Jan
E. Warren,"We need a candidate who will excite all parts of the Democratic Party, bring everyone in, and give everyone a Democrat to believe in. That’s my plan, and that is why I’m going to win.",Jan
Moderator 2,"Senator Klobuchar, what do you say …",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"Thank you, Elizabeth.",Jan
Moderator 2,"Senator Klobuchar, what do you say …",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,I would like to …,Jan
Moderator 2,"Senator Klobuchar, let me finish my question.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"Oh, okay.",Jan
Moderator 2,What do you say to people who …,Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"I thought it was such an open end. I wasn’t at the meeting, so I can’t comment, but I was going to say …",Jan
Moderator 2,What do you say to people who say that a woman can’t win this election?,Jan
Amy Klobuchar,I hear that. People have said it. That’s why I’ve addressed it from this stage. I point out that you don’t have to be the tallest person in the room. James Madison was five foot four. You don’t have to be the skinniest person in the room. You don’t have to be the loudest person. You have to be competent.,Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"When you look at the facts, Michigan has a woman governor right now, and she beat a Republican, Gretchen Whitmer. Kansas has a woman governor right now, and she beat Kris Kobach. Her name is … I’m very proud to know her, and her name is Governor Kelly. Thank you.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"Third, I would add to this you have to be competent to win, and you have to know what you’re doing. When you look at what I have done, I have won every race, every place, every time. I have one in the reddest of districts. I have won in the suburban areas, in the rural areas. I have brought people with me. That is why I have the most endorsements of current Iowa legislators and former Iowa legislators in this race …",Jan
Moderator 2,Thank you.,Jan
Amy Klobuchar,… because I know I bring people with me.,Jan
Moderator 2,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"Finally, every single person that I have beaten, my Republican opponents, have gotten out of politics for good. I think that sounds pretty good. I think that sounds pretty good with the guy we have in the White House right now.",Jan
Moderator 2,"Senator Sanders, you can respond.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Well, just to set the record straight, I defeated an incumbent Republican running for Congress.",Jan
E. Warren,When?,Jan
Bernie Sanders,"1990. That’s how I won. Beat a Republican Congressman. Number two, of course …",Jan
E. Warren,30 years ago.,Jan
Bernie Sanders,… I don’t think there’s any debate on …,Jan
E. Warren,Wasn’t that 30 years ago?,Jan
Bernie Sanders,I beat an incumbent Republican Congressman.,Jan
E. Warren,I said I was the only one who has beaten an incumbent Republican in 30 years.,Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Well, 30 years ago is 1990, as a matter of fact. But I don’t know that that’s the major issue of the day. I think what the major issue of the day is … Does anybody in their right mind thing that a woman cannot be elected President? That’s enough. Nobody believes that. Hillary Clinton got 3 million votes, more votes than Trump. So who believes that a woman can’t win? Of course a woman can win.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"But the real question is how do we beat Trump? The only way we beat Trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has, by far, the largest voter turnout in the history of this country.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,I believe that our campaign has the strongest grassroots movement.,Jan
Moderator 2,Thank you.,Jan
Bernie Sanders,We are endorsed by many grassroots organizations.,Jan
Moderator 2,"Senator Warren? Senator Warren, I want to give you the final word.",Jan
E. Warren,"So I do think it’s the right question, how do we beat Trump? Here’s the thing. Since Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have outperformed men candidates in competitive races. In 2018, we took back the House. We took back state houses because of women candidates and women voters.",Jan
E. Warren,"Look. Don’t deny that the question is there. Back in the 1960s, people asked, “Could a Catholic win?” Back in 2008, people asked if an African American could win. Both times, the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes, got behind their candidate, and we changed America. That’s who we are.",Jan
Moderator 2,"Vice President Biden? Vice president Biden, go ahead.",Jan
Joe Biden,"I agree women can win, and I’ve went in and campaigned for 27 of them, this last in 2018 the best group I’ve ever campaigned for in terms of competence. But the real issue is who can bring the whole party together and represent all elements of the party, African Americans, brown, black, women, men, gay, straight? The fact of the matter is that I would argue that, in terms of endorsements around the country, endorsements wherever we go, I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race.",Jan
Moderator 2,"All right, we’re going to take a short break now. The CNN Democratic Presidential Debate, live from Drake University, will be right back. Let’s turn to healthcare, the top issue for Iowa Democrats. Donald Trump is trying to repeal Obamacare, including the protections for preexisting conditions. We all know that each of you vigorously opposes that. Still, there are some questions about what each of you would do.",Jan
Moderator 2,"Senator Sanders, you’ve consistently refused to say exactly how much your Medicare for All plan is going to cost. Don’t voters deserve to see the price tag before you send them a bill that could cost tens of trillions of dollars?",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Well, what I will tell you is Medicare for All, which will guarantee comprehensive healthcare to every man, woman, and child, will cost substantially less than the status quo. Medicare for All will end the absurdity of the United States paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and healthcare in general.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"While we have 87 million uninsured and underinsured and while 30,000 people die each year, on the Medicare for All, one of the provisions we have to pay for it is a 4% tax on income, exempting the first $29,000. So the average family in America that today makes $60,000 would pay $1,200 a year, compared to that family paying $12,000 a year. We save money, comprehensive healthcare, because we take on the greed and the profiteering and the administrative nightmare that currently exist in our dysfunctional system.",Jan
Moderator 2,"Vice President Biden, does Senator Sanders owe voters a price tag on his healthcare plan?",Jan
Joe Biden,"I think we need to be candid with voters. I think we have to tell them what we’re going to do and what it’s going to cost, and a 4% tax on income over $24,000 doesn’t even come close to paying for between 30 and some estimates as high as $40 trillion over ten years. That’s doubling the entire federal budget per year.",Jan
Joe Biden,"There’s a way to do that. The way to do that is to take Obamacare, re-instate, rebuild it, provide a public option, allow Medicare for those folks who want it, and, in fact, make sure that we, in the process, reduce the costs of drug prices, reduce the cost of being able to buy into the … subsidize it further, and make it available to everyone. Here’s the deal. That costs a lot of money that cost $740 billion over ten years. I lay out how I pay for that.",Jan
Moderator 2,Senator Sanders?,Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Well, first of all, what Joe forgets to say is when you leave the current system as it is, what you are talking about, all workers paying, on average, 20% of their incomes for healthcare, that is insane. You’ve got 500,000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills. We’re spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Look. We’ve talked about healthcare for all in this country for over 100 years. Now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the healthcare industry, of the drug companies, and finally provide healthcare to all through a Medicare for All single payer program. It won’t be easy, but that is what we have to do.",Jan
Moderator 2,Vice President Biden?,Jan
Joe Biden,You can do it without Medicare for All. You can get the same place.,Jan
Moderator 2,"Senator Klobuchar, your response?",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"Yeah. Senator Sanders and I have worked together on pharmaceuticals for a long, long time, and we agree on this. But what I don’t agree with is his position on healthcare. This debate isn’t real. I was in Vegas the other day, and someone said, “Don’t put your chips on a number on the wheel that isn’t even on the wheel.” That’s the problem.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,Over two thirds of the Democrats in the US Senate are not on the bill that you and Senator Warren are on. You have numerous governors that are Democratic that don’t support this. You have numerous House members that put Nancy Pelosi in a speaker.,Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"The answer is a nonprofit public option. The answer is the real debate we should be having is how do we make it easier for people to get coverage for addiction and mental health. I have a plan for that, and then, finally, what should we do about long-term care, the elephant that doesn’t even fit in this room? We need to make it easier for people to get long-term care insurance. We need to make it easier for them to pay for their premiums.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"My own dad, I know when his long-term care insurance ends, and then we have some savings for him. He’s in assisted living. He got married three times, whole nother story. So there isn’t much there. But then we go to Medicaid, and I’ve already talked to Catholic elder care. They’re willing to take him in.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,Our story is better than so many other families. We have to make it easier for long-term care.,Jan
Moderator 2,"Thank you. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,It’s not just for senators. It’s also for the sandwich generation …,Jan
Moderator 2,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,… people trying to help their parents.,Jan
Moderator 2,Senator Warren?,Jan
E. Warren,"So we need to start with what’s happening in America. People are suffering. I’ll just pick one. 36 million people last year went to the doctor, got a prescription. This is what they needed to get well, and they couldn’t afford to have the prescription filled. They looked at it and said, “It’s either groceries or this prescription.”",Jan
E. Warren,My approach to this is we’ve got to get as much help to as many people as quickly as possible. I have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle class families by one thin dime.,Jan
E. Warren,"What I can do are the things that I can do as President on the first day. We can cut the cost of prescription drugs. I’ll use the power that’s already given to the President to reduce the cost of insulin and EpiPens and HIV/AIDS drugs. Let’s get some relief to those families, and I will defend the Affordable Care Act.",Jan
E. Warren,"I’ve got a plan to expand healthcare. But let’s keep in mind, when we come to a general election, we Democrats may argue among each other about the best way to do healthcare, but we’re going to be up against a Republican incumbent who has cut healthcare for millions of people and is still trying to do that. I’ll take our side of the argument any day. We’re going to beat him on this.",Jan
Moderator 2,"Thank you. Thank you, Senator Warren. Vice President Biden?",Jan
Joe Biden,"The  my layout does, in fact, limit drug costs. It allows all the drug companies to … Excuse me, it allows Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price. It’s sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation. By the way, there’s mental health parity that I call for in the Obamacare expanded with the Biden option.",Jan
Moderator 2,Mr. Steyer?,Jan
Tom Steyer,"Look. We’ve had this conversation on this stage so many times. Everybody on this stage believes that affordable healthcare is a right for every single American. Everybody on this stage knows that Americans are paying twice as much for healthcare as any other advanced country in the world. It makes no sense, and the government has to step in.",Jan
Tom Steyer,"I do happen to agree with vice President Biden that we should move and develop the Affordable Care Act with a public option, but the real question is this. This is not a new problem. Why do we keep having this conversation? We have a broken government. It has been bought by corporations that include the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the private hospitals.",Jan
Tom Steyer,"That’s what I’m talking about. How do we get back government of, by, and for the people? How do we actually break the corporate stranglehold on our government so that we can get any of these things passed?",Jan
Moderator 2,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Senator Sanders, your campaign proposals would double federal spending over the next decade, an unprecedented level of spending not seen since World War II. How would you keep your plans from bankrupting the country?",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"No, our plan wouldn’t bankrupt the country. In fact, it would much improve the wellbeing of working class families and the middle class. Let us be clear what Medicare for all does. It ends all premiums. It ends all copayments. It ends the absurdity of deductibles. It ends out-of-pocket expenses. It takes on the pharmaceutical industry, which, in some cases, charges us ten times more for the same prescription drugs sold abroad as sold here.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"What we will do through a Medicare for All single payer program is substantially lower the cost of healthcare for employers and workers, because we end the hundred billion dollars a year that the healthcare industry makes and the $500 billion a year we spend an the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans.",Jan
Bernie Sanders,Healthcare is a human right. Every other major country on Earth is guaranteeing healthcare for all. The time is long overdue for us to do the same.,Jan
Moderator 2,Senator Klobuchar?,Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"Again, I think it is much better to build on the Affordable Care Act, and if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipe dream, you have to show how you’re going to pay for it.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"I would also note, practically, that the Affordable Care Act right now is ten points more popular than the President of the United States. So I think the answer is to build on it, and yes, I think you should show how you’re going to pay for things, Bernie. I do. This President is  people out. They’re like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"The way he is adding to our debt, I am the one person up here who has on her website, in her plan, a plan to actually start taking on the deficit by taking part of that money from that corporate tax cut that they put in there and putting it in a fund to pay back the deficit.",Jan
Moderator 2,"Thank you. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"I have shown how I’m going to pay for every single plan, capital gains that’s going to the personal level …",Jan
Moderator 2,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,… getting rid of the oil giveaways …,Jan
Moderator 2,Let’s move on.,Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"… doing something about the hedge fund loophole. You can go through, and you can get the money to pay for things.",Jan
Moderator 2,"Senator Klobuchar, your time is up. Let’s move on to the next question. Mayor Buttigieg, you’re selling your plan as Medicare for all who want it. Yet your plan would automatically enroll uninsured Americans into a public option, even if they don’t want it, and force them to pay for it. How is that truth in advertising?",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, it’s making sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured American. Look. The individual mandate was an important part of the ACA, because the system doesn’t work if there are free riders.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"What I’m offering is a choice. You don’t have to be in my plan if there’s another plan that you would rather keep, and there’s no need to kick Americans off the plans that they want in order to deliver healthcare for all. My plan is paid for. Look. Our party should no longer hesitate to talk about the issue of the debt and the deficit. We’ve got a dramatically better track record on it than Republicans do. In my lifetime, it’s almost invariably Republican Presidents who have added to the deficit. $1 trillion under this President.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"It’s why everything I’ve put forward, from Medicare for all who want it to the historic investments we’re going to make an infrastructure to dealing with climate change is fully paid for. What comes to healthcare, you can do it in two moves. Of course, my plan costs $1.5 trillion over a decade. No small sum, but not the 20, 30, 40 that we’re hearing about from the others.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"All I’ve got to do is two things. Both of them are common sense. Allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, and roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,Roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations and the wealthy that didn’t even need it.,Jan
Abby P,Senator Warren.,Jan
E. Warren,"So I started this by talking about 36 million Americans including Americans with insurance who just can’t even afford to have a prescription filled. We all talk about plans, healthcare plans that we have, and these plans are paid for. The problem is that plans like the mayor’s and like the vice president’s is that they are an improvement. They are an improvement over where we are right now. Not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for 36 million people who can’t afford to get them filled. What we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from. We can ask those at the very top, the top 1% to pay a little more. Those giant corporations like Chevron and Amazon who paid nothing in taxes. We can have them pay, and we can go after the corporate tax cheats. And when we do that, we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people.",Jan
E. Warren,"Tax cheats. And when we do that, we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people. Yes, we build on the Affordable Care Act, but where we end up is we offer healthcare to all of our people, and we can offer it at no cost or low cost to all of them.",Jan
Abby P,Mayor Buttigieg.,Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"It’s just not true that the plan I’m proposing is small. We’ve got to move past a Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the treasury, that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate. This would be a game changer. This would be the biggest thing we’ve done to American healthcare in a half century.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"Let’s measure the effects of our plans based on what they would do in our everyday lives and yes, we’re taking on costs on prescription drugs, we’ll have an out-of-pocket cap. Even if you don’t get the subsidies that would make it free, a $250 monthly cap and here’s why it’s got to be monthly. You ever been in that situation or known somebody who finds that they’ve got to defer a procedure or delay filling a prescription to try to have it happen in the right month because of when your out-of-pocket cap hits? It makes no sense medically because most of us don’t experience the economy on an annual basis. Our bills don’t come in every year. They come in every month. Same with our paychecks, biweekly or monthly. That’s why we set this up in a way to solve the problem without running up 20, 30 $40 trillion bills.",Jan
Abby P,"Senator Warren, your response.",Jan
E. Warren,"Look, the numbers that the mayor’s offering just don’t add up. The average family in America last year paid $12,000 in some combination of deductibles and copays, and uncovered expenses and fees. You can’t cover that with the kind of money that the mayor is talking about. The way we have to approach this is we’ve got to build this and we’ve got to build the alliances to make this happen. I can bring down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the system immediately in costs. We can get help to families, but we have to be willing to work together.",Jan
E. Warren,"We can let people experience what healthcare is like when it’s you and your doctor, your mental health professional, your nurse practitioner with no insurance companies standing in the middle.  When people try it and use it, then.",Jan
Abby P,"Thank you, Senator Warren. Senator Klobuchar?",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"Senator Warren, you acknowledged that Medicare for all, that you couldn’t get there right away. You got on the bill that said on page eight, which is why I didn’t get on it, that you would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance. Then a few months ago, you said, “No, you’re going to wait a while to get there.” And I think that was some acknowledgement that maybe what we’re talking about is true. And I don’t buy that it’s not enough. It is a big, big step to say to people making $100,000 a year that, “Your premiums will be cut in half.” Which is what the nonprofit public option will do. And if you talk, mayor Buttigieg, about Medicare and having negotiation, I actually have led that bill for years. I have 34 co-sponsors. As president, I can get it done. That would allow Medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they can’t negotiate for better prices for our seniors. I will it done.",Jan
Abby P,"Senator Sanders, coming to you now. CNN reached out to Iowa Democratic voters for their most pressing questions. Edward from here in Des Moines writes, “Des Moines is an insurance town. What happens to all the health insurance industry here if there is Medicare for all? What happens to all the jobs and the livelihoods of the people that live in insurance towns like Des Moines?”",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"We build into our Medicare for all program a transition fund of many, many billions of dollars that will provide for up to five years income and healthcare and job training for those people. But here is the issue, Tom Steyer made the point a moment ago. We are now spending twice as much per person on healthcare as do the people of any other country. That is insane. In some cases, 10 times more for prescription drugs. Why is that? Why is that? And the answer is the greed and corruption of the drug companies and the insurance companies. And if we want to do what every other major country on Earth does and guarantee people healthcare as a human right, not a privilege, you know what we have to do? We are finally going to have to stand up to the healthcare industry-",Jan
Tom Steyer,Can I respond to this?,Jan
Bernie Sanders,And end hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and profiteering.,Jan
Abby P,Mr. Steyer.,Jan
Tom Steyer,"I just want to emphasize what Senator Sanders said. This is not a complicated problem. Between what Senator Warren and Senator Sanders said, it’s clear. There are two problems. We’re spending way too much because corporations own the system, and we’re not negotiating against those corporations and we’ve given tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations for decades. That’s all this is. We have corporations who are having their way with the American people and people are suffering. Senator Warren is right. This is cruelty for money. In order to break this, we’re going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem. That’s why I’m for term limits. We need to redo Washington DC  and actually take back the government from the corporations who bought it.",Jan
Abby P,"Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden?",Jan
Joe Biden,"I would argue that the biggest breakthrough in recent time was us being able to do in our administration what five Democratic presidents couldn’t get done, and that is pass Obamacare. It was a big deal. Secondly, I would argue that the way you control drug prices is you limit what they can charge for those prices, you don’t have to pay the price. Limit what they can charge. If in fact they charge more than we set the price for, in fact, people can import from abroad assuming that it is safe. We in fact… It’s only yellow. Okay? And we can in fact do all of this and still provide people the option to stay the roughly 150 to 160 million Americans who like the negotiated plan they have with their employers, if they don’t like it or the employer gets rid of it, they can buy into a Medicare plan in the Biden plan.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Let’s talk a little bit more about prescription drugs right now. Prescription drug prices in 2018, Americans spent $335 billion on prescription drugs alone. That’s about $60 billion more than they paid a decade ago. Senator Warren, you’ve called for the creation of a government-run drug manufacturer that would step in if there is a drug shortage or a price spike. Why does it make sense for the government to manufacture drugs, especially when public trust in government is near historic lows?",Jan
E. Warren,"So, let’s do this both ways. What I also have said is I’m just going to use the power that is available, and I will do what a president can do all by herself on the very first day, and that is lower the prices of certain prescription drugs. I will lower the price of insulin. We already have the legal authority with the president to do that. President just hasn’t picked up and used it. I will lower the price of EpiPens, of HIV/AIDS drugs. That’s going to bring a lot of relief to a lot of families immediately, but you know there are a whole lot of drugs, about 90% of drugs that are not under patent. They’re generic drugs, but the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up. So my view is let’s give them a little competition.",Jan
E. Warren,"The government lets contracts for all kinds of things. They let contracts to build buildings, they let contracts to build military weapons. Let’s let the contracts out, put the contracts out so that we can put more generic drugs out there and drive down those prices. This is a way to make markets work, not to try to move away from the market. You don’t have to even use price controls. The whole idea behind it is get some competition out there so the price of these drugs that are no longer under patent drops where it should be.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Senator Klobuchar, do you believe the government should be manufacturing drugs?",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"I am open to looking at it, but I would try these things first. Number one, I mentioned the Medicare negotiation. Number two, I have a plan, 137 things I’ve found that a president can do herself in the first 100 days without Congress that are legal, and one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries. Bernie and I had an amendment on this. We got 14 Republican votes on it. It was at midnight. They might’ve not known what they were voting for, but we got that. I now have an actual bill with Senator Grassley that does that, and I have a bill to get at what Elizabeth was talking about, which is to stop generics from taking money from big pharmaceuticals to keep their products off the market. The issue here is that there are two pharma lobbyists for every member of Congress.",Jan
Brianne P,"Thank you, Senator.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"They think they own Washington. They don’t own me. And as president, I will get this done.",Jan
Brianne P,"Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. We’re going to turn now to childcare, a huge expense for many new families and a problem that’s especially acute in rural Iowa. We have another question from an Iowa Democratic voter. Mayor, Buttigieg, this is for you. Tiffany from Clive writes, “As a young mom, I had to quit a job I love because childcare costs were taking up two thirds of my income. Many families don’t have the option of quitting a job because that little bit of income is needed. That leads to families using whatever care they can find, and sometimes the results are deadly as we’ve seen in Iowa over the last few years. How will you prioritize accessing quality affordable childcare in your first 100 days in office?”",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"It makes no sense for childcare to cost two thirds of somebody’s income. We’ve got to drive it to 7% or below, and zero for those families who are living in poverty. But this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum. I meet professionals who sometimes say that they’re working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working. It makes no sense and it must change and we shouldn’t be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality. Subsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education as well as childcare at large. We can do that and until we do this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap because when somebody’s like the the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason, she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in, and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career.",Jan
Brianne P,"Senator Warren, your education plan includes tuition-free public college for all, but you impose an income limit for free childcare. Why do your plans cover everyone for public college, but not childcare and early learning?",Jan
E. Warren,"No, actually my plan is universal childcare for everyone. It just has some people adding a small payment, but understand this about the plan. I’ve been there. You know, I remember when I was a young mom, I had two little kids and I had my first real university teaching job. It was hard work. I was excited, but it was childcare that nearly brought me down. We went through one childcare after another and it just didn’t work.",Jan
E. Warren,"If I hadn’t been saved by my Aunt Bee, I was ready to quit my job. And I think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on. How many of my daughter’s generation get knocked off the track and don’t get back on. How many mamas and daddies today are getting knocked off the track and never get back on.",Jan
E. Warren,"I have a two-cent wealth tax so that we can cover childcare for all of our children and provide universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in America, and stop exploiting the people who do this valuable work, largely black and brown women. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America. That’s an investment in our babies. That’s an investment in their mamas and their daddies and it’s an investment in our teachers and in our economy.",Jan
Brianne P,"Senator Sanders, will your universal-",Jan
E. Warren,It’s what we need to do.,Jan
Brianne P,Child care program be free for everyone regardless of income?,Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Yeah. Let me just pick up on this childcare thing. Every psychologist in the world knows zero through four are the most important years of human life, intellectually and emotionally, and yet our current childcare system is an embarrassment. It is unaffordable. Childcare workers are making wages lower than McDonald’s workers. We need to fundamentally change priorities in America. We should not be one of the few countries that does not have universal, high quality, affordable childcare. We should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. We should not be spending more than the 10 next countries on the military, hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. Tax breaks for billionaires, and then to tell the moms and dads in this country, “We cannot have  high-quality, affordable childcare.” That is wrong.",Jan
Brianne P,"Vice President Biden, infant care is more expensive than in-state public college tuition in more than half the country. Do you support free universal infant care?",Jan
Joe Biden,"There should be free, universal infant care, but here’s the deal. I was a single parent too when my wife and daughter were killed. My two boys I had to raise. I was a young Senator. I just hadn’t been sworn in yet, and I was making $42,000 a year. I commuted every single solitary day to Wilmington, Delaware over 500 miles a day. Excuse me, 250 miles a day because I could not afford, but for my family, childcare. It was beyond my reach to be able to do it and that’s why there’s several things we do.",Jan
Joe Biden,"When I tripled the amount of money for title one schools, every child three, four and five-years-old will in fact have full schooling. They’ll go to school and after school programs, which will release some of the burden. Secondly, I think we should have an $8,000 tax credit, which would put 7 million women back to work. They could afford to go to work and still care for their children as an $8,000 tax credit. I also believe that we should, in fact, for people who in fact are not able to afford any of the infant care to be able to get that care. But Bernie’s right. We have to raise the salaries of the people who are doing the care, and I provide for that as well. My time is up. I know, but I’m not going to go over like everybody.",Jan
Brianne P,"Mayor Buttigieg, higher education is another huge expense for families. You oppose free public college for all because you don’t want to make it “free for the kids of millionaires”. But lots of public services are available to the kids of rich people like libraries and public schools. Why do you draw the line at public colleges and universities?",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"Well, it’s simple. We expect and hope for everyone to get through 12th grade. It’s not the same for college. Now again, I don’t want cost ever to be a barrier to somebody seeking to attend college, and under my plan it won’t be. Matter of fact, for the first 80% of Americans by income, it is free at public colleges, but if you’re in that top income bracket, don’t get me wrong, I still wish you well. I hope you succeed when you go to college. I just need you to go ahead and pay that tuition because we could be using those dollars for something else.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"There is a very real choice about what we do with every single taxpayer dollar that we raise. And we need to be using that to support everybody, whether you go to college or not, making sure that Americans can thrive, investing in infrastructure and something that hasn’t come up very much tonight, but deserves a lot of attention. Poverty, you know, the Poor People’s Campaign is marching on Iowa right now, calling on us to talk about this issue more. They are driven by their faith. I think, because even though in politics we’re supposed to talk middle-class, they know there’s no scripture that says, “As you’ve done under the middle-class, so you’ve done unto me.”",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"We got to be making sure that we target our tax dollars, where they will make the biggest difference. And I don’t think subsidizing the children of millionaires and billionaires to pay absolutely zero in tuition of public colleges is the best use of those scarce  taxpayer dollars.",Jan
Brianne P,Senator Warren.,Jan
E. Warren,"So look, the way I think we need to do this is we need a wealth tax in America. We need to ask people with fortunes above $50 million to pay more, and that means that the lowliest millionaire that I would tax under this wealth tax would be paying about $19 million in the first year in taxes. If he wants to send his kid to public university, then I’m okay with that because what we really need to talk about is the bigger economic picture here. We need to be willing to put a wealth tax in place to ask those giant corporations that are not paying to pay because that’s how we build an economy and for those who want to talk about it, bring down the national debt. You do universal child care, and you got a lot of mamas who can go to work. A lot of mamas who can finish their education. We make that investment in universal college. We’ve got  people who would finish an education.",Jan
Brianne P,"Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar.",Jan
Abby P,"Yeah. You know, I  appreciate your thoughts, Elizabeth, but I want to step back. I actually think that some of our colleagues who want free college for all aren’t actually thinking big enough. I think what we have to look at is how we connect our education system with our economy. Where are our job openings, and what do we need? We are going to have over a million openings for home healthcare workers that we don’t know how to fill in the next 10 years. We are going to have open 100,000 jobs for nursing assistants. We, as my union friends know, we’re going to have over 70,000 openings for electricians. We’re not going to have a shortage of MBAs. We’re going to have a shortage of plumbers. So, when we look at that, then we step back. Where should our money go? It should go into K-12 it should go into free one and two-year degrees like my dad got like my sister got.  And then we double the Pell grants because we’re going to need four-year degrees so the money goes where it should go instead of two rich kids going to college.",Jan
Brianne P,"Mr. Steyer, as a billionaire, should your children have been entitled to free public college?",Jan
Tom Steyer,"No. And let me say this, I was one of the people who talked about a wealth tax, almost a year-and-a-half ago. I believe that the income inequality in this country is unbearable, unjust and unsupportable, and the redistribution of wealth to the richest Americans from everyone else has to end. And I proposed a wealth tax almost a year-and-a-half ago to start to address it and to raise some of the money that we need. But I want to go beyond this and go back to this question about education because we’re talking a lot about college.",Jan
Tom Steyer,"But in fact, if you talk about the Poor People’s Campaign, you have to realize that for the youngest kids, they are getting an education that’s relative to the taxes in their neighborhoods. We need to redistribute money so every kid has a chance. So we’re not legislating inequality for the next generation. And so, we actually invest in every single kid, specifically poor kids, specifically black kids, specifically brown kids. We need to start using the money dramatically more for that.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"We’ll be back with more from CNN’s Democratic Presidential Debate live from Des Moines, Iowa.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"… Senate, launching the third trial of a US president. The Republican-led Senate has signaled that it is likely to acquit him, Vice President Biden, if you’re the nominee, is it going to be harder to run against President Trump if he’s been acquitted and able to claim vindication, especially after what he said about your family?",Jan
Joe Biden,"It’s irrelevant. There’s no choice but for Nancy Pelosi and the House to move. He has in fact committed impeachable offenses. Whether the Senate makes that judgment or not is for them to decide, and by the way, I’m told that I say we have to unite the country. It’s going to be harder after this trial. It may be, but look, you know, I understand how these guys are, this Republican party. They’ve gone after, Savage, my surviving son. Gone after me, told lies that your networks and others won’t even carry on television because they’re flat out lies, and I did my job. The question is whether or not he did his job. And he hasn’t done his job, and so it doesn’t really matter whether or not he’s going after me, I’ve got to be in a position that I think of the American people. I can’t hold a grudge. I have to be able to not only fight, but also heal, and as president of the United States, that’s what I will attempt to do, not withstanding that we’re going to be more division after he’s defeated by me this next time.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Senator Klobuchar, going to be a juror in the trial in the Senate that’s about to start. Do you worry President Trump will be emboldened by acquittal?",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"No. We have a constitutional duty to perform here. And when I look at what the issue is, it’s whether or not we’re going to be able to have witnesses. We’ve asked for only four people as witnesses, and if our Republican colleagues won’t allow those witnesses, they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter. They may as well make him king. And last time I checked, our country was founded on this idea that we didn’t want to be ruled by a king.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"And I think the best way to think about this trial and what we’re facing in this election is a story of a man from Primghar, Iowa. His name was Joseph Welch. He came from humble beginnings, a son of immigrants. He became the army counsel, and he was the one that went to the Joseph McCarthy hearings. And when McCarthy was blacklisting people and going after people because of their political beliefs or supposed political beliefs, there was only one man. Everyone that was afraid, they’re afraid of being blacklisted. Joseph Welch, he stood up and looked at McCarthy and said, “Have you no sense of decency, sir? Have you no sense of decency?”",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,This is a decency check on our government. This is a patriotism check. Not only is this trial that-,Jan
Wolf Blitzer,Thank you.,Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"But also this election, and no matter if you agree with everyone here on the stage, I say this to  Americans, you know this is a decency check on this president.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Mr. Steyer, you’ve spent millions and millions of dollars telling the American people that President Trump deserves to be impeached. Will it have been worth it if he’s been impeached but not removed from office?",Jan
Tom Steyer,"Well Wolf, actually what I’ve done is to organize a petition drive of eight-and-a-half million Americans to sign and say this president deserves to be impeached and removed from office. And those eight-and-a-half million people have called their Congress people, have emailed their Congress people and have actually dragged Washington DC to see that in fact, this is a question of right and wrong and not of political expediency.",Jan
Tom Steyer,"So, if you ask me whether standing up for what’s right in America, standing up for the American people and our safety, standing up for the constitution, whether doing that and trying to bring the truth in front of the American people in televised hearings so we can decide what the truth is for ourselves, if you think that that isn’t worth it, then you don’t share the idea that I do about what America’s about. Standing up for what’s right is always worth it, Wolf, and I will never back down from that.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Senator Warren, a Senate trial is expected to keep you in Washington in the weeks leading up to the Iowa caucuses here. How big of a problem is that for you as you’re making your closing pitch to voters here?",Jan
E. Warren,"Look, some things are more important than politics. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. It says that no one is above the law that includes the president of the United States. If we have an impeachment trial, I will be there because it is my responsibility. But understand this, what that impeachment trial is going to show once again to the American people, and something we should all be talking about, is the corruption of this administration. That’s what lies at the heart of it. It is about Donald Trump putting Donald Trump first, not the American people, not the interests of the United States of America, not even in helping Ukraine defend against Russia. It is about him helping himself. That is what we need to do to win this election. We need to draw that distinction and show that as Democrats, we’re not going to be the people who are just out for the big corporations, people who want to help themselves, that we are going to be the party that is willing to fight on the side of the people. That’s why we’re here.",Jan
Brianne P,"Let’s turn now to the climate crisis. Here in Iowa, parts of the state remain underwater after record-breaking flooding began last spring, racking up an estimated $2 billion in damages. Today, many Iowans are still displaced from their homes. Mayor Buttigieg, you’ve talked about helping people move from areas at high risk of flooding, but what do you do about farms and factories that simply can’t be moved?",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"That’s why we have to fight climate change with such urgency. Climate change has come to America from coast to coast. We’re seeing it in Iowa. We’ve seen it in historic floods in my community. I had to activate our emergency operation center for a once in a  flood. Then two years later, had to do the same thing. In Australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place. This is no longer theoretical. This is no longer off in the future. We have got to act, yes to adapt, to make sure our communities are more resilient, to make sure our economy is ready for the consequences that are going to happen one way or the other. But we also have to ensure that we don’t allow this to get any worse. And if we get it right, farmers will be a huge part of the solution. We need to reach out to the very people who have sometimes been made to feel that accepting climate science would be a defeat for them.

Brianne P.,"Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Mr Steyer, what’s your response?",Jan
Tom Steyer,"Look, what you’re talking about is what’s called managed retreat. It’s basically saying, we’re going to have to move things because this crisis is out of control and it’s unbelievably expensive. And of course, we’re going to come to the rescue of Americans who are in trouble. But this is why climate is my number one priority. And I’m still shocked that I’m the only person on this stage who will say this. I would declare a state of emergency on day one on climate. I would do it from the standpoint of environmental justice and make sure we go to the black and brown communities where you can’t breathe the air or drink the water that comes out of the tap safely. But I also know this, we’re going to create millions of good paying union jobs across this country. It’s going to be the biggest job program in American history.",Jan

Brianne P.,"Mr. Steyer, to clarify, you say you’re the climate change candidate, but you made your $1.6 billion in part by investing in coal, oil, and gas. So are you the right messenger on this topic?",Jan
Tom Steyer,"I absolutely am. Look, we invested in every part of the economy and over 10 years ago I realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels, that we had to change. So I divested from fossil fuels. I took the giving pledge to give most of my money away while I’m alive. And for 12 years, I’ve been fighting the climate crisis.

I have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully-",Jan

Brianne P.,"Thank you. Mr Steyer. Senator Warren, President Trump is rolling back major environmental rules to allow pipelines and other major infrastructure projects to be built without strict environmental review. Will you restore those protections and in a way that the next president can’t overturn?",Jan
E. Warren,"Yes. Climate change threatens every living thing on this planet and the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated. I will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day. I will roll back the environmental changes that Donald Trump is putting in place. I will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands and offshore drilling. That’ll help us get in the right directions. I’ll bring in the farmers. Farmers can be part of the climate solution. We should see this though for the problem it is. Mr. Steyer talks about it being problem number one. Understand this, we have known about this climate crisis for decades. Back in the 1990s, we were calling it global warming, but we knew what it was. Democrats and Republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem.",Jan

I think it is going to lead to so many problems and one thing that hasn’t been raised by the way is the rules on methane, which is actually one of the most environmentally dangerous hazards that they have recently embarked on. And I would bring those rules back as well as a number of other ones.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"When it comes to the issue of fracking, I actually see natural gas as a transition fuel. It’s a transition fuel to where we get to carbon neutral. Nearly every one of us has a plan that is very similar and that is to get to carbon neutral by 2045 to 2050. To get to by 2030 do a 45% reduction. And I want to add one thing that no one’s really answered.

We are seeing Australia burning. We saw California burning. The drought here in Iowa is going to make it harder for farmers to produce the food that we need. This is of course a national crisis. I’ve introduced legislation to indicate it’s an actual crisis.

If I’m elected president, I’ll reinstate all the mileage standards that existed in our administration, which were taken down, that’s 12 billion gallons of gasoline, barrels of gasoline to be saved immediately. And with regard to those folks who in fact are going to be victimized by what’s already happened.

Support that you’ll need in order to beat Donald Trump. Is it possible that black voters have gotten to know you and have simply decided to choose another candidate?",Jan

It’s why among elected black officials in my community, who have gotten into this race, by far most of them are supporting me. And now nationally, I am proud that my campaign has co-chaired by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and to have support right here in Iowa from some of the most recognizable black elected leaders. From Mayor Hart of Waterloo to former Representative Berry in Black Hawk County. Now, the biggest mistake we could make is to take black votes for granted and I never will. The reason I have the support I do is not because any voter thinks that I’m perfect. It’s because of the work that we have done facing some of the toughest issues that communities can.",Jan

And I’m proud to say we’ve been nationally recognized for our work as a race informed city on delivering greater economic justice. That we have reduced use of force by leading the region in transparency around the use of force in policing. Of course, there is a much longer way to go, in my community and around the country.

Abby Phillips,"Senator Sanders, you call yourself a democratic socialist, but more than two thirds of voters say they are not enthusiastic about voting for a socialist. Doesn’t that put your chances of beating Donald Trump at risk?",Jan
Bernie Sanders,"Nope, not at all. And that is because the campaign that we are going to run will expose the fraudulency of who Donald Trump is. Donald Trump is corrupt. He is a pathological liar and he is a fraud. Now when Trump talks about socialism, what he talks about is giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. Donald Trump as a businessman, received $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury housing. My democratic socialism says healthcare is a human right. We’re going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. We’re going to make public colleges and universities tuition free. We’re going to have a Green New Deal and create up to $20 million, saving the planet for our children and our grandchildren. We are going to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance company. That is what democratic socialism is about and that will win this election.",Jan
Abby Phillips,"Mr. Steyer, you’ve spent more than $100 million of your own dollars on television ads. How do you convince voters that you’re more than just your money?",Jan
Tom Steyer,"Look, we know how Donald Trump is going to run for president. He’s going to run on the economy. He’s already told Americans last month in Florida, you don’t like me and I don’t like you, but you’re all going to vote for me because the Democrats are going to destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control. So let’s be clear, I started a business by myself in one room. I didn’t inherit a penny from my parents. I spent 30 years building that business into a multi-billion dollar international business. Then I walked away from it and took the giving pledge and started organizing coalitions of ordinary Americans to take on unchecked corporate power. But whoever is going to beat Mr. Trump is going to have to beat him on the economy and I have the experience and the expertise to show that he’s a  and a fraud. Look, Mayor Pete has three years as an analyst at McKinsey. I have 30 years of international business experience, I can beat Trump on the economy. We’re going to have to beat him on the economy and I look forward to taking him down in the fall on the debate stage.",Jan
Abby Phillips,Mayor Buttigieg.,Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"You demoted me, I was actually an associate but that’s okay. It was not the biggest part of my career, but I am ready to take on this president on the economy because I am from the exact kind of industrial Midwestern community that he pretends to speak to and has proven to turn his back on and guided that community through a historic transformation. When at the beginning of the decade I took office, we were described as a dying city. I’m ready to take on Donald Trump because when he gets to the tough talk and the chest thumping, he’ll have to stand next to an American war veteran and explain how he pretended bone spurs made him ineligible to serve.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"And if and if he keeps trying to use religion … If a guy like Donald Trump keeps trying to use religion to somehow recruit Christianity into the G.O.P., I will be standing there not afraid to talk about a different way to answer the call of faith and insist that God does not belong to a political party. I am ready to take on this president on every front.",Jan
Abby Phillips,"Thank you. Senator Klobuchar, you’re pitching yourself as a practical candidate who can get things done. And even tonight you’ve dismissed some of the ideas that are offered in this primary as pipe dreams. How are you going to inspire democratic voters with a message of pragmatism?",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"Our voters, actually all Americans have seen now a number of years of a guy that has, I think, told over 15,000 lies. He is someone that literally has a rap sheet of divisive rhetoric. And I think what Americans want is something different. I am going to be able to stand across from him on that debate stage and say to my friends in Iowa, the Midwest is not flyover country for me, I live here. I’m going to be able to look at him and say, you’ve treated these workers and farmers like poker chips. For me, these are my friends and these are my neighbors. I’m going to be able to look at him and say, you know what? You got $413 million over the course of your career, that’s how you built your fortune.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"And what I’m going to say is this, my grandpa worked 1500 feet underground in the iron ore mines, saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to a two year community college. That’s my family trust. And when you have been given an opportunity like that, you go into the world, not with the sense of entitlement, Donald Trump, but with a sense of obligation.",Jan
Abby Phillips,"Thank you. Senator Warren, what do you say to voters who like your policies but they’re worried they will scare away swing voters you need to win this race in November?",Jan
E. Warren,"So I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I have three older brothers who are all retired, who are all back there still. And two of my three brothers are Republicans. And sure, there are a lot of things we disagree on and we can take to our corners and do the Democratic, Republican talking points. But the truth is there’s a whole lot we agree on. You know, my brothers just furious over Chevron and Eli Lilly and Amazon, that are giant corporations make billions of dollars in taxes … make billions of dollars in profits and pay nothing in taxes. My brother said, “I don’t get this. I have to pay my taxes. Somebody has to keep the roads paved and the schools open and pay for our defense.”",Jan
E. Warren,"They understand that we have an America right now that’s working great for those at the top. It’s just not working for anyone else. We have a chance to unite, unite as Democrats, but also with independents and Republicans, who are sick of living in a country that’s working great for the politicians that are taking the money. It’s working great for the lobbyists. It’s working great for the corporate executives. It’s just not working for everyone else. I’m building the grassroots movement, leading the fight. We’re going to make this America work for everyone else. That is how we’re going to beat Donald Trump.",Jan
Abby Phillips,"Vice President Biden, the eventual nominee will face President Trump, who has no problem mocking people using insulting nicknames, slinging mud, and telling lies. The debate against him will make tonight’s debate look like child’s play. Are you prepared for that?",Jan
Joe Biden,"I am prepared for that. Look, I’ve been the object of his affection now more than anybody else on this stage. I’ve taken all the hits he can deliver and I’m getting better in the polls, my going up. And by the way, I have overwhelming support from the African American community, overwhelming more than everybody else in this operation, number one. Number two, working class people, where I come from in Pennsylvania and the places I come from in Delaware, I have great support. I have support across the board and I’m not worried about taking on Donald Trump at all. And with regard to the economy, I can hardly wait to have that debate with him. Where I come from, the neighborhoods I come from, they’re in real trouble, working class people and middle class people. When the middle class does well, working class has a way up and the wealthy do well. But what’s happening now? They’re being clobbered, they’re being killed.",Jan
Joe Biden,"They now have a situation where if they … the vast majority believe their children will never reach the stage that they’ve reached an economic security. I love that debate because the American public is getting clobbered. The wealthy are the only ones doing well, period. I’m looking forward to the economic debate.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"We’ll be right back with more from CNN’s Democratic presidential debate, live from Des Moines, Iowa. Stay right here.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"…. Iowa. Time now for closing statements, you each have one minute. Senator Klobuchar, let’s begin with you.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"Donald Trump thinks this is all about him. I think it’s about you. It’s not about his resorts or his tweets or even his ego. It is about your healthcare. It is about your schools. It is about your lives and your future. So if you want to do something about racial justice and immigration reform and climate change and gun safety, we need a candidate who is actually going to bring people with her. I have won every race, every place, every time. I have gotten the highest voter turnout in the country when I’ve led the ticket. I have passed more bills as the lead Democrat than anyone who’s in Congress that’s running for president. I believe that we need a president that’s going to look out for you. It is easy to hurl insults. It is easy to draw lines in the sand and sketch out grand ideological sketches that will never see the light of day.",Jan
Amy Klobuchar,"What is hard is bringing people together and finding common ground instead of scorched earth. What is hard is the work of governing. So if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me. Join me at amyklobuchar.com.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,Mr. Steyer.,Jan
Tom Steyer,"I know that Iowans are going to caucus within three weeks and I want to tell you how I feel about the American people. Look, I played team sports my entire life. The bond between teammates is deep and emotional and full of love and as far as I’m concerned, the American people are my teammates. And if there’s one thing I will not permit, it is someone to run down the field and kick my teammate in the face. And that is exactly what I’ve seen over the last seven years traveling around this country, seeing these Republicans led by Mr. Trump, basically kicking the American people in the face. I am prepared to take on Mr. Trump on the debate stage and take him down on the economy. But I am asking for your support because I know that if I’m going to be a good teammate to you and give you absolutely everything without any compromise, I need the support of you on caucus night so I can turn around and together we can take back this country and together we can save the world.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,Mayor Buttigieg.,Jan
Pete Buttigieg,"This is our moment. This is our one shot to defeat Donald Trump and to do it by such a big margin that we send Trumpism into the dustbin of history too. Well, we cannot take the risk with so much on the line of trying to confront this president with the same Washington mindset and political warfare that led us to this point. If you are watching this at home and you were exhausted by the spectacle of division and dysfunction, I’m asking you to join me to help turn the page on our politics. You’re seeing the President boast about the Dow Jones wondering whether any of that will ever get to your kitchen table. Join me if you’re a voter of color feeling taken for granted by politics as usual. Join me if you’re used to voting for the other party, but right now cannot look your kids in the eye and explain this president to them, join me.",Jan
Pete Buttigieg,We have a chance to change all of this if we can summon the courage to break from the past. That is why I am running for president. It is why I’m asking you to caucus for me on February 3rd and I hope that you will go to peteforamerica.com and join me in this effort.,Jan
Wolf Blitzer,Senator Warren.,Jan
E. Warren,"So, much is broken in this country. I sat here in the break and just made notes about many of the things we didn’t get to talk about tonight. How the disability community is struggling for true equality, how gun violence and active shooter drills worry every mother in this country. How children are living in poverty and seeing their life chances shrink. How trans women, particularly trans women of color are at risk. Black infant mortality, climate change that particularly hits black and brown communities. People who are being crushed by student loan debt, farmers who are barely holding on, people struggling with mental illness. And yet I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope and it’s filled with hope because I see this as our moment in history, our moment when no one is left on the sidelines. Our moment when we understand that it comes to us to decide the future of this country. Our moment when we build the movement to make real change, hope and courage. That is how I will make you proud every day as your nominee and as the first woman president of the United States of America.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,Senator Sanders.,Jan
Bernie Sanders,"It’s been a good debate, but we haven’t asked the major question. The major question is how does it happen in the richest country in the history of the world that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, trying to get by, $9, $10 bucks an hour? How does it happen that when the top one percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92%, half a million people are sleeping out on the streets tonight? How does it happen in this great country we are the only major nation not to guarantee healthcare to all. How does that happen that we have a child care system which is dysfunctional, a criminal justice system which is broken and racist, an immigration system that needs reform. This is the moment when we have got to think big, not small. This is the moment where we have got to have the courage to take on the one percent, take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create an economy and create a government that works for all of us, not just the one percent. Thank you.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,Vice President Biden.,Jan
Joe Biden,"Character is on the ballot this time around. The American character is on the ballot. Not what Donald Trump is spewing out, the hate, the xenophobia, the racism. That’s not who we are as a nation. Everyone in this country is entitled to be treated with respect and dignity. Every single solitary person has to have in a position that may in fact we treat them with decency. It’s about fundamental, basic decency. We in the United States of America can put up with … we can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but eight years of Donald Trump will be an absolute disaster and fundamentally change this nation. We have to restore America’s soul. As I’ve said from the moment I announced, it is in jeopardy under this President of the United States. We lead the world when we lead by example, not by our power.",Jan
Joe Biden,"We in fact have to regain the respect of the world in order to be able to change things. Ladies and gentlemen, we are in a position right now we have to remember who we are. This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity to do if we do it together, let’s go do it.",Jan
Wolf Blitzer,"Candidates, thank you very, very much. That concludes the first Democratic presidential debate of 2020. The Iowa caucuses are only 20 days away. Tune into CNN for continuing coverage of this presidential election. Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo pickup our coverage right now.",Jan
